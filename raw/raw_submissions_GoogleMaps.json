However, I arrived at a point where I find that My Maps is limited for my uses and I started looking at alternatives.\n\nLet me start by pointing out what I like about Maps:\n\n* Easy to use. I can search for a destination, select it, play with the icon and save it. The menus are fast and I don't have to go through endless windows to set up what I like (Something that seems to be rather tedious on Earth from my brief experience)\n* The icons are great. Sure, I wish that their library would be larger, but since all of them have a grey background and a white icon, I can create my own custom colour codes for icons that are in the same group. *The background colour changes, but the white design doesn't. It's brilliant.*\n\nAnd here comes the not so great points:\n\n* I can't have more than 10 layers. This means I have to group places from an entire continent instead of a trip/country. The list of entries in one layer can get big quickly (I don't know what the limit of markers per layer is, but I'd imagine I could reach it). I don't want to create one map for each trip, I want everything centralised.\n* No way to sort entries alphabetically. \n* No way to multi-select and edit markers. Doing 2000 markers one at a time is incredibly tedious, I can't believe that no one thought of implementing such a feature.\n* No way of transferring multiple markers from one layer to another via drag and drop, it has to be done individually (or through KML edits, but that be tedious as well if markers are not one after another)\n* No way of importing a custom icon library in one go, it has to be done icon by icon.\n\nNow, from my brief exposure to Google Earth, this is what I gathered:\n\n* It supports a lot more layers in the form of folders. I'm slightly annoyed that whenever I make a new folder, it always ends up at the bottom and I can't seem able to create a folder within a folder, even though I can drag &amp; drop it thereafter creation without a problem. In the grand scheme of things, it's not that bad.\n* Earth has a lot more info related to locations. I can also include photos, descriptions etc. of every marker I place. That's great as I can link my photos to the map.\n* I can import my map from My Maps and the icons and the colour scheme come through, however, they've not added to the library automatically. I'm yet to find a way where I can export the default Maps icons and use them on Earth (is this even possible?)\n* I wanted to import a custom icon pack from MapIcons. Firstly, I can only add one icon at a time, just like in Maps. Secondly, the colour I choose is applied to the entire Icon, even the white design which I want to remain white.\n* While Earth has more functionalities, the menus are designed like something from the 2000s. Endless clicking through tabs and pop-up windows. It's inefficient in my eyes when you want to edit thousands of entries.\n* No multi-select for drag &amp; drop from one folder to another. To me, having to modify the KML file to recreate the folder structure I want to have in Earth and move markers around is 100% not the way things should be done. Especially when the markers are not necessarily already sorted country, it'll be hard to scan the entire file and figure out which marker needs to go where without the visual aid of the map alongside.\n* No multi-edit of similar markers.\n\nI can live with some of the issues in GE, but having icons that behave just like in Maps (only the background colour changes, the white design stays white) and marker relocating are important to me. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nCheers,\n", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "dsh99yw", "body": "You can update the icons etc at folder level rather than one at a time.

And it\u2019s all with the most beautiful backdrop you could ever imagine (on clear days.)\n\nLived in Alaska my entire life and that road is my favorite part of the state.\n\nEdit: Apparently my first comment was deleted? Here is a copy/paste.\n\n\"Denali Park road, **vehicles are only allowed on it 3 days a year at the very end of the season (why it\u2019s snowing) and you have to win an online lottery to get a permit to drive it.** There are a million rules, one of them being you can\u2019t approach animals with vehicles which is why everyone is giving him such a wide space.\n\nI\u2019ve done the drive a couple times and it\u2019s always amazing.\"\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nWhen you go to it on [Google Earth,] (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Denali+Park+Rd,+Denali+National+Park+and+Preserve,+AK+99755/@63.7215116,-149.0056053,13.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x56ccdf524e1b873f:0x96f27455e4073570!8m2!3d63.7341606!4d-148.9120552) there is no Street View.\n\nAs this is such an amazing road and it is only open three days each year, I would hope the Street View Team could make it a priority to get up there and drive it.  \n\nLove to get this message to the powers that be.  Any help with this would be appreciated.

I've been using the Street View app on a Galaxy S8+ to submit them so far but purchased a Samsung Gear 360 earlier this week so I could try some more involved projects. As a test, I went to a nearby all-season trail on the 24th and with a tripod folded up in my backpack, tested the interval mode so it would take a shot every few seconds. I walked the 20 minute loop and submitted all the shots when I got home. All photos were available in the correct place shortly after and I was showing them to a few people, when I checked later in the day - most were gone. I went back to the Street View app and clicked on a few random ones and they all say \"Maps Rejected\". There are only a few left visible to the public and they are no different so I assume these will vanish too. \n\nCoincidentally, the 2 that I submitted many months ago using just my phone are still there - one was even a quick submit and isn't even a full sphere. With nearly all the new stuff gone, this trip feels like a complete waste. None of the pictures contain and logos, text, or even people - just straight hiking trail and the unavoidable shots of the back of my head from where the camera was mounted.

Several people were copied on the email, including people with the local telephone company, the 911 address management service people, several people in the county clerk's office, people with att, and people with the Post Office. To confirm, I went to the post office and had them look it up in their database as if they were going to ship a package there, and they confirmed it now exists. \n\n3) The confirmation document I received includes an older satellite photo of the property (though the new parking lot next door is not yet there), with addresses and property lines defined. It also has a long parcel ID number included.\n\n4) I have searched around for such a spot for sending Google more information with attachments but have been unsuccessful. They won't let you message them or contact them easily, from what I've found.

No more than 10-15 minutes into my drive I get a notification that I am out of data (I have 2 gigs total). \n\nWhen I got home I checked the usage. I used about 0.5 gigs within that short drive (again I have a map downloaded for this area and background data turned off). The data usage for that trip was about .02 GB of foreground data and .47 GB of background data. Why is it using background data when I have that setting turned off???\n\nLike I said, this never happened until about 2 months ago. I would use maps all the time in the same fashion and never have any issue. \n\nSo what is going on here? Is it android auto? Should I turn off my data anytime I'm driving so it uses offline maps?", "comments": []}, {"subreddit": "GoogleMaps", "sub_id": "8bwf8n", "title": "I found the entrance to another universe in La Mesa, CA", "url": "https://imgur.com/a/iNS7j", "author": "FrootDoggo", "score": 8, "created": "2018-4-13", "numComms": 0, "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/8bwf8n/i_found_the_entrance_to_another_universe_in_la/", "flair": "NaN", "selftext": "", "comments": []}, {"subreddit": "GoogleMaps", "sub_id": "8by2ze", "title": "An unfortunate traveler", "url": "https://i.redd.it/mbyu70dwinr01.png", "author": "Saphira2014", "score": 20, "created": "2018-4-13", "numComms": 2, "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/8by2ze/an_unfortunate_traveler/", "flair": "NaN", "selftext": "", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "dxajg7c", "body": "Getting absorbed by rocks is no good", "author": "trancepx", "score": 3, "created": "2018-4-13", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/8by2ze/an_unfortunate_traveler/dxajg7c/", "parent_id": "t3_8by2ze"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "dy4pkq8", "body": "rock boye", "author": "BeefyOreo7", "score": 2, "created": "2018-4-29", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/8by2ze/an_unfortunate_traveler/dy4pkq8/", "parent_id": "t3_8by2ze"}]}, {"subreddit": "GoogleMaps", "sub_id": "8bzbqn", "title": "Maps Timeline 500 Error", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/8bzbqn/maps_timeline_500_error/", "author": "craigh_uk", "score": 2, "created": "2018-4-13", "numComms": 1, "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/8bzbqn/maps_timeline_500_error/", "flair": "NaN", "selftext": "This seems to have been going on now for months if not years, Try to access the Maps Your Timeline function and all you get is a 500 error and the only place it works fine is on a mobile device app.\n\nHave seen so many posts and Google doing their usual 'Do nothing' approach \\- does anyone have a solution or is it a case of they can't be bothered and that's it?\n\nHow many are affected??

Forty-two people were confirmed dead, with five more missing and presumed dead. More than 30 buildings in the town's centre, roughly half of the downtown area, were destroyed, and all but three of the thirty-nine remaining downtown buildings had to be demolished due to petroleum contamination of the townsite.

Beginning June 11th, we are launching our new pricing plan and providing all users access to support. We\u2019ll continue to offer a free tier \u2014 all developers will receive $200 of free monthly usage of our core products.\n\nIn addition, this change will require you to enable billing and associate it with all of your Google Maps Platform projects. Creating a billing account helps us better understand your usage so we can continue developing helpful products. It also allows you to scale easily with less downtime and fewer performance issues if your product grows beyond the $200 of free monthly usage.

For example, if the given address was [1398 N Sanford Rd, Afton, NY 13730](https://maps.google.com/?q=1398+N+Sanford+Rd,+Afton,+NY+13730&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g), you would use this address to get an output somewhere near Fusa Blvd, Diana, NY.  \nOptionally, you can create a collection in Postman or whatever tool you prefer with the necessary API calls.\n\nAnyone able to help? Thank you in advance", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e12iisy", "body": "As I see it, the steps to accomplish this task are basically:\n\n1. Find the latitude/longitude for the given address, i.e. **geocode** the address.\n2. Use those coordinates to calculate the latitude/longitude of the location 138 miles due north.\n    * The longitude should be the same since we're not moving west or east at all.\n    * According to Wikipedia, [a difference of one degree latitude \u2248 111km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_latitude). (Technically, it varies a tiny bit depending on how far away you are from the equator, but fortunately the question says \u201croughly\u201d.) Doubling that, 222 km (138 mi) correponds to a two-degree difference in latitude, we simply add 2 to the latitude we got from the last step. What a convenient distance!\n3. Take the latitude/longitude from the previous step and use **reverse geocoding** to find the closest address to that point.\n\nSo using the example address from the question:\n\n**1** By sending the API request `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1398+N+Sanford Rd,+Afton,+NY+13730&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY`, we geocode the address to get the coordinates. All we really care about is the `geometry`/`location` portion of the response:\n\n    \u2026\n    \"geometry\": {\n        \"location\": {\n            \"lat\": 42.1792879,\n            \"lng\": -75.4277321\n         },\n    \u2026\n\n**2** The latitude of the location 138 miles north of that address is 42.1792879 + 2 = **44.1792879**. The longitude is the same. So the latitude/longitude we\u2019ll need to reverse geoencode is `44.1792879,-75.4277321`.\n\n**3** Now, using the reverse geocoding API, we send this request: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=44.1792879,-75.4277321&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY`. The response gives a bunch of different `results`. Each one is a different way to describe the address\u2014some specific, some less so. Each item in the `results` array includes an item called `formatted_address`, which is basically the one-line summary. Here are the `formatted_address` results we get in response to that API request:\n\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Fusa Blvd, Gouverneur, NY 13642, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Diana, NY, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Gouverneur, NY 13642, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Lewis County, NY, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"New York, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"United States\"\n\nEven though we got a street name, we didn\u2019t get an actual address.

Looking on the map it seemed interesting and was through an area I wasn't familiar with.  So off I went...\n \nAt the very first place that I was to leave paved city roads and get onto a bike path, there was a big sign prohibiting bicycles!!!!  The sign showed that bicycles should be walked and not ridden in that area.  But now that I was already there and quite far from the route I would take regularly (mostly surface streets) I decided to try anyway.  I rode onto the path and kept going... keeping my eyes open for officials.\n \nAfter a few kilometers I was back on quiet residential streets and I was thinking this was pretty cool (other for the part where I wasn't supposed to be riding).\n \nNext I was on a small gravel road (I've got a mountain bike so that's okay) for about a kilometer and then came up to a locked gate blocking my access.  I double checked the Google directions and indeed it had me going through there.  I could see the nice gravel road/path continuing past the gate and I saw it was possible to walk through the bush on one side and get around the gate so I did that.  I continued on, for about 2 km when I came to ANOTHER locked gate blocking my exit from that area.  And there was no way to climb that gate or go around it.  At this point I was pretty mad at Google Maps for getting me there.  I would have to backtrack all the way and find another way in an area I wasn't familiar with.  As I turned around and started back I noticed a faint trace of path through the woods and bush.  I walked the bike through that (and there was LOTS Of POISON IVY!!!!!!!) carefully and then got back on a paved road that was part of an access or service road to a highway (Hwy 13, south of Gouin) with very heavy and very fast traffic!

Anyone that experiences to problem should use the feedback on Google maps.  \n", "author": "YouMeAndPooneil", "score": 1, "created": "2018-8-16", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/97etn4/maps_changed_my_route_twice_during_navigation/e48p6ht/", "parent_id": "t3_97etn4"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e4a4eew", "body": "I noticed this as well.

I remember when I first discovered street view. So enamored with it was I that nowadays I feel a tinge of nostalgia when I come across a country road whose most recent Google car snapshot was taken back in 2007. These images are grainy and often dark, but still strangely beautiful, if only for what they represented--the world, for the first time, and so much as it ever could be, at your fingertips.\n\nGoogle created one of the most astounding, vast, and deep libraries of information ever concieved when it developed street view. But Google went one step further, allowing its users to upload photographs and eventually videos and 360\u00b0 viewpoints from anywhere in the world. The process was simple yet magical: simply upload the photo and pin it to the proper location on the map, and suddenly you, little old me or you, had added a small piece to the internet's greatest library of easily accessible, geotagged photos.\n\nOne could spend hours on a rainy summer afternoon pouring over photos of obscure and nameless locales in Greenland, Southeast Asia,  some island in the middle of the ocean; or even the backwoods of your own stomping grounds. Google Maps has given all of us an incredible amount of freedom to explore, as well as a resource for research, and even a launching point for adventure.\n\nI guess this is a love letter to Google Maps, and an expose of how much it has meant to me. But also I wish to bemoan how the service has been corrupted in some small ways--most notably, with the recent shutdown of Panoramio, and the accompanying loss of innumerable photos.\n\nNot only were an immense amount of photos tossed into the recycle bin of internet history, but also in justification Google's best excuse for deleting the archive was (I paraphrase), 'protectibg the privacy of Panoramio users.' That reason is made hollow by the plainly obvious fact that none of those users actually shared Google's concern for the aforementioned privacy, as it was the users who put those photos in the public sphere to begin with. And Panoramio had so much that you won't find on Google Maps if you look today. Photos of remote, nameless places, as well as historic photographs and imagery geotagged and accessible on Maps.\n\nI will go on just a little more, as Google has committed one more sin against its own service that I would like to call out. As mentioned before, adding photos to Google Maps used to be as simple as uploading the content and pinning it on the map. But that has changed. Now, every photo has to be tied to a location already named on Google Maps. In order to upload, you type in a place, upload the photo, and there you go...a photo of said place, whether or not the photo is actually of said place or of a nearby landmark that Google does not know or care about. This severely restricts the freedom users once had in sharing photos of any place they had been to. Sure, a lot of photos are placed incorrectly by users, but that's no excuse to remove everyone's ability to precisely place a photo on the map.\n\nTL;DR\nI love Google maps, have had nothing but a wonderful time with it and have grown genuinely fond of it over the years it has blessed us with its existence. But I am sad to see Google strip away some of the best features when it comes to community sontibuted photos. Panoramio is gone and never coming back, and the new photo layer format in general is more restrictive and (some say) catering to advertisers over individual users.\n\nMost of all I am sad to see something as monumental as Panoramio go out with barely a whimper. Not so much as a poorly made tribute video on YouTube. Maybe I'll make one. Anyone got any links to archived Panoramio content?\n\nP.S.-I know that photos can still be uploaded and precisely placed on Google Earth. Thank God for that, it's all we've got left as far as that goes.\n\nP.P.S.-mad props to Google for upgrading Google Maps to a spherical format. The Mercator projection is an abomination and Maps is infinitely better for transcending it.\n\nP.P.P.S.-do you love Maps as much as I do?

I think I've located a massive impact crater using google earth, and I think it ties in with some fringe theories, I have recently become acquainted with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt all started when I watched a youtube video a few days back, which put forth the theory that the myth of Atlantis might be based on the demise of a prehistoric civilization which inhabited the feature know as the Eye of Sahara - and the arguments put forward in the video were very compelling, as both the size, location, shape and even it's relation to north and south seems to match the description provided by Plato. If you like to entertain such ideas, I suggest you check out the video for context [The Lost City of Atlantis - Hidden in Plain Sight - Advanced Ancient Human Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDoM4BmoDQM) \\- the host of this channel puts forward a lot of ideas in other videos that I disagree with, but in relations to this subject I feel he had a lot of interesting input.  \n\n\nIn the video they share the following image, in relation to something called the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothisis. There seems to be a lot of controversy regarding this theory, and it has yet to be fully discarded or approved by the academic community. Basically there are ice core samples from multiple source around the planet which indicate that at around 12.800 years ago, and again, about 1000 years later, the world experienced two quick bursts of extreme warming and flash flooding, basically overnight, and it is suggested that this was caused by some sort of extra terrestrial impact, and as far as I can gather, everything from asteroids and meteors, to sun flares/bursts has been on the table.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/520pmm3k7fl11.jpg\n\nThis picture is also shared in other videos on the same channel, and in those the host elaborates further on its meaning. The picture is supposed to indicate that North America was impacted 12.800 years ago, and it is then explained that this caused massive flash floods which contributed to the extinction of several mega fauna, carved out the landscape and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nI don't really understand the values on this map, but my gut instinct tells me that the impact would more likely be in the Middle East, since the values there are highest, and that the values found elsewhere show the trajectory of the impact as it explodes across the northern hemisphere.\n\nSo after this thought hit me I went on to google earth and started looking for a crater. I actually did this two evenings in a row. The first evening I looked at the Sahara and I was amazed by how much it looks as though a massive wall of mud has washed across northern Africa. But no matter how much I looked I didn't seem to find any origin of these patterns.\n\nBut the next day I zoomed out a bit more, and I started looking for bigger patterns, and as I scrolled towards the Middle East and beyond I found something. \n\nJust north of Tibet there is a desert that looks like a massive crater, and if you follow it's trajectory it aligns almost perfectly with the dry and arid areas that define the landscape from the Middle East, across the Arabian Peninsula and all the way to the west coast of northern Africa. Check out the collage below, that I have stitched together with pictures from google earth.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r807hmhs4fl11.jpg\n\nJust a coincidence? Maybe. I don't know enough about any of these subject to judge for myself.\n\n  \nBut I feel like it fits well with the ideas that an impact ended the last ice age, crossed massive havoc in northern Africa and might have been the source of both the multiple  deluge myths from across different cultures, including that of Atlantis and Noah. The Sahara desert was once a lush area, and I've heard the the sands of the desert supposedly come from the ocean. I personally always thought that these areas were so dry due to lack of precipitation, but seeing how the rest of the earths landmass which inhabits the same areas just north of the equator can still sustain vegetation I think there might be another reason why we see this pattern stretched across three tectonic plates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me hear your thoughts. :D", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e5q6nvf", "body": "It's not unknown, and this is a purely speculative video about that being Atlantis, not an impact crater anyway.", "author": "xj20", "score": 7, "created": "2018-9-11", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9enz6j/massive_unknown_impact_crater_located_using/e5q6nvf/", "parent_id": "t3_9enz6j"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e5q6snr", "body": "Perhaps unidentified would have been a more proper choice of word.

It's possible it had something do to with that, or fishing, or quarrying.

Fishermen bring to the island an old car which they drive up and down the beach until it wears out or gets hopelessly stuck. This in itself does no real harm unless the car is driven over dune grass or through bird nesting grounds, but the car is eventually left to rust on the beach, where it is an esthetic insult and a safety hazard. No one wants to pay to have a valueless vehicle ferried ashore. There are probably over a thousand such hulks on Core Banks (Fig. 116). Most builders of cabins are squatting on the land, since at present most of the land in Cape Lookout National Seashore is owned by the state of North Carolina. Although some people have put up neat, decent little buildings, many of the cabins are unsightly, vermin-infested hovels surrounded by rubbish (Figs. 117 and 118).

I like that on average, everyone in the city has seen one or two of my photos. Does anyone else love this? I'm wondering what your tips are for getting your photo to the top photo ribbon slots. I'll share my tips as well.  Look for what hasn't been photographed. In my experience, Google is looking for 3 things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  Storefront - from about the distance of the road\n2. overall atmosphere - Empty tables and chairs, empty tables and chairs, empty tables and chairs! Those shots have some of the highest percentage of success for me. Additionally you can shoot empty aisles for non food places\n3. product - close up glamor shots of your dinner plate or one product in particular from the shelves \n\nIf any one of these 3 are missing or lower quality than your photos, focus on that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, Google seems to love a few characteristics:\n\n1.  Natural light - about 70% of my top shots are lit entirely by the sun. So that dark restaurant that's so popular, take a photo by the window\n2. Good quality - goes without saying, but I'll say it. Lots of pixels make a better picture\n3. Recent - Given two photos of similar quality and value, I think Google is going to go with the more recent. So if you've lost the top spot somewhere, go photograph it again\n4. Avoid people - Particularly their faces pointing toward the camera. Of my top 20 photos, only a couple have people in them, but they're on the fringes of the photo and well separated from the subject. I think Google prefers an atmosphere shot of a place, but it's so hard to get without people, so it sticks storefronts and products in the top slot instead (so get those empty tables and chairs!)\n5. Video - There is a time and place for video, and you should take full advantage of it!  The top slot for a massive public place like the zoo, aquarium, or theme park is very, very difficult to get, but video can gain you serious viewership because of the way they're displayed on GM. When displayed, the video will play in the thumbnail and people can't help themselves but to click it to see more. I found the most successful place to be the zoo. People liked watching short (5-6s) clips of the animals (especially predators) moving in some way up close. \n6. Panoramic - I've had very little luck with panoramic. Only 1 of my top 20 was pano, and it was only on top for a month\n7. Photo sphere - Always good for at least a couple thousand views, but I've never seen it hit to top ribbon\n8. Portrait mode - Google seems to have no preference for portrait mode photos, but people still do view/click them more often than the regular photos 100 to 1 (maybe google should take the hint lol)\n9. Slow-mo -  Treat it just like portrait mode. People like to watch, but it will never make the top ribbon \n10. Other things I've tried that GM doesn't care about - Menus, product showcases or advertisements in the store, any decor or posters on the walls, anything with a human subject (even if they're not facing the camera), signage\n\nI'm about at the end of things I can be almost certain of, although I have more theories I'll be testing.

In the morning, civil twilight begins when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon and ends at sunrise.

[Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) coordinates are expressed using the WGS-84 standard and when plotted on street maps of China that follow the GCJ-02 coordinates, they appear off by a large (often over 500 meters) and variable amount. Authorized providers of location-based services and digital maps (such as [AutoNavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoNavi) or [NavInfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NavInfo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)) must purchase a \"shift correction\" algorithm that enables plotting GPS locations correctly on the map.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-Corr-34) Satellite imagery and user-contributed street map data sets, such as those from [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) also display correctly because they have been collected using GPS devices (albeit technically illegally - see [Legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#Legislation)).\n\nSome map providers, such as [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_(company)), choose to also offset their satellite imagery layer to match the GCJ-02 street map.[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-35)\n\nGoogle has worked with Chinese [LBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service) provider [AutoNavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoNavi) since 2006 to source its maps in China.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-bloomberg-36) google.*cn*/maps (formerly Google Ditu) uses the GCJ-02 system for both its street maps[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-37) and satellite imagery.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-38) However, the WGS-84 positions reported by a browser are depicted at the wrong positions. On the contrary, google.*com*/maps also uses GCJ-02 data for the street map, but doesn't shift the satellite imagery layer, which continues to use WGS-84 coordinates,[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-39) with the benefit that WGS-84 positions can still be overlaid correctly on the satellite image (but not the street map). Google Earth also uses WGS-84 to display the satellite imagery.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-40)\n\nOverlaying GPS tracks on [Google.com Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps) and any street maps sourced from Google.com via its API, will lead to a similar display offset problem, because GPS tracks use WGS-84, and Google.com maps use GCJ-02. The issue has been reported numerous times on the Google Product Forums since 2009,[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-41) with 3rd party applications emerging to fix it.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-42) Data sets with offsets for large lists of Chinese cities existed for sale.[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-43) The problem was observed as early as 2008, and the causes were unclear, with (misguided) speculation that imported GPS chips were tampered with code that caused incorrect reporting of coordinates.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-44)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author": "n0esc", "score": 28, "created": "2018-10-19", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9piq1w/shenzen_streets_dont_line_up_with_satellite/e822b5h/", "parent_id": "t3_9piq1w"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e82nl90", "body": "That does explain the driving.", "author": "Melba69", "score": 2, "created": "2018-10-20", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9piq1w/shenzen_streets_dont_line_up_with_satellite/e82nl90/", "parent_id": "t3_9piq1w"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e83eymp", "body": "/u/Charge0781, if you are using the website, simply replace \".com\" in the URL with \".cn\" to fix the issue.", "author": "fj333", "score": 1, "created": "2018-10-20", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9piq1w/shenzen_streets_dont_line_up_with_satellite/e83eymp/", "parent_id": "t1_e822b5h"}]}, {"subreddit": "GoogleMaps", "sub_id": "9pkofo", "title": "Is there a way to save street view images so that I don't lose the current versions if they get updated?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9pkofo/is_there_a_way_to_save_street_view_images_so_that/", "author": "goodbye-moon-men", "score": 1, "created": "2018-10-20", "numComms": 4, "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9pkofo/is_there_a_way_to_save_street_view_images_so_that/", "flair": "NaN", "selftext": "", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e82ie41", "body": "You can see all past street view instances on this slider while in street view [https://i.imgur.com/mR6UGle.png](https://i.imgur.com/mR6UGle.png)", "author": "ThisIsNowAUsername", "score": 5, "created": "2018-10-20", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9pkofo/is_there_a_way_to_save_street_view_images_so_that/e82ie41/", "parent_id": "t3_9pkofo"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e83as30", "body": "Actually this is not always correct...\nYou can lose it when the road layout is changed.

The design of the road is based on safety. Some speeding is fine, I agree, because the road is designed to allow you to safely travel somewhat faster than the posted speed limit. But if you are SO concerned about speed traps that you need an app to protect you from getting caught, just get over yourself. Drive like there's always a speed trap. As you argue later on, going 5 or even 10 over the limit might not get you nabbed. Any faster than that and you're endangering lives.\n\nBut absolute speed absolutely affects safety. You can't make the same turn going 80 as you can at 60 and you can't stop as quickly going 60 as you can at 30. The outcomes are worse at higher speeds too. Damage becomes more significant, the likelihood of death increases, etc.\n\nExample 1: If you drive 29mph when everyone else is going 10mph you won't get a ticket for speeding. You may get a ticket for reckless driving or something else. But if it's a speed trap you're worried about, don't be.\n\nExample 2: Correct, for the reason I outline above, which is that speed limits are set based on the design of the road.\n\nExample 3: The 35'er is not \"very dangerous\", but they are frustrating, and when drivers become frustrated they become aggressive and dangerous. In all the hypothetical situations where someone is driving well-below the speed limit the only crashes that aren't caused by aggressive drivers are where there's a blind curve and as someone gains on the slower vehicle they don't it's there. Which is why if the speed limit is 50 and someone is going 35, they should be over to the right as far as practical and anyone who wants to pass has to wait until it is safe to pass. Anyone who has driven on a country road or up a hill behind a heavy truck knows how to handle this situation.\n\nIf they aren't as far over to the right as practical then that is illegal and they can be pulled over.\n\nSometimes speed traps are about ticketing people and collecting fines, but speed limits are not based on that, they are based on engineering, and sometimes just a desire to keep traffic slow in a neighbourhood (although, if the road design isn't adjusted as appropriate, then people are more likely to continue speeding).\n\nDon't speed. and if you do, don't speed by very much.

The same scenario at 60mph is much much more likely to be lethal. You are much less likely to able to regain control of your vehicle. Even something like stopping distance is a factor of SPEED, not \"relative speed\".\n\nIf you nudge another car while travelling 80mph the chances of you both careening off the highway are much, much greater than a similar collision with the same \"relative speed\" but an absolute speed of 30mph.\n\nYou're not thinking critically about this.", "author": "WestendMatt", "score": 1, "created": "2018-11-11", "permalink": "/r/GoogleMaps/comments/9tq3cd/speed_trap_feature_slightly_useless/e9ge0g8/", "parent_id": "t1_e9blx3d"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e9genjg", "body": "Well, in the very specific examples you give you are correct.

But that is not the whole story which I have exhaustively explained above...  most accidents, other than fender-benders, are with other vehicles. Thus, a car that is going faster or SLOWER than the surrounding traffic is more dangerous than any arbitrary absolute speed. So, simply stating that a car, or cars, going above a speed limit is more dangerous is over simplified and misleading. The car going 35 when traffic is going 65 IS much more dangerous than the car going 70 is the same situation.\n\nHave you ever had the car in front of you move out of the way, only to find a much, much slower vehicle i front of him (now you)?  Or come around a bend and encountering a slowing or stopped vehicle?  Again, it's relative speed.\n\nYou may be an urban planner but I can tell you with certainty that speed limits have little or nothings to do with \"safety\" of the road.

All speed is relative.\n\nIn the event of suddenly encountering a slower vehicle, your speed relative to the road determines the distance it takes for you to come to a stop. Your speed relative to the other vehicle determines how much damage there is in the initial collision, but the speed of the two vehicles relative to the road determines what happens after that. The faster you are all going, the worse it is going to be.\n\nVehicle A is travelling 50mph, Vehicle B is travelling 45mph. Relative speed difference: 5mph. Severity of crash: moderate.\n\nVehicle C is travelling 80mph, Vehicle B is travelling 75mph. Relative speed difference: 5mph.

Look it up if you don't believe me.\n\n2) Only the straighter, more level sections of the autobahn have no speed limit.\n\n3) Do you want the same strict licensing system that Germany has?\n\n4) Here are some interesting stats: https://brandongaille.com/17-fascinating-autobahn-accident-statistics/\n\n&gt;67% of the accidents that occurred on the Autobahn happened in sections where there was no posted speed limit.\n&gt;A 2008 report from the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) looked at 645 road deaths in Germany, and found that 67 percent occurred on highway sections without limits.\n&gt;The accident rate on the Autobahn is consistently lower than many other interstate style highway systems, partly because of its better construction \u2013 it has a 40 year rating. The US highway system has a 20 year rating.\n&gt;The annual fatality rate on the Autobahn in 2.7 per billion kilometers traveled. The United States has a 4.5 fatality rate for the same distance and highly controlled speeds to boot.\n&gt;Most drivers stick to the advised speed limit (130km/h) on unregulated stretches of the Autobahn \u2013 only about 1/3 of drivers historically exceed the recommended speed limit.\n\nSo it really isn't the driving paradise you seem to think it is, and it isn't about \"relative speed\" between vehicles at all.\n\nOh, and this is interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn#Construction\n&gt;The top design speed was approximately 160 km/h (99 mph) in flat country but lower design speeds were used in hilly or mountainous terrain. A flat-country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the Nazi period, could support the speed of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) on curves.\n\nAnd here's the wiki page about \"design speed\" so we're all on the same page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_speed\n\nSo I hope you'll at least try to understand why I say that speed limits are \"based on\" the design of the road.

Apart from this, its a conventional road maps, that offers aerial and satellite views of many places. In some cities. It also offers street views comprising photographs taken from vehicles.\n\nGoogle Maps features walking, driving and transit directions for both the iPad and iPhone along with voice guided GPS navigation. It is available on over 220 countries and territories with transit directions included for over 15,000 major cities around the world. It also comes with Google's popular Street View feature built right in to help you find exactly what you're looking for. It provides real-time estimated time of arrival using current traffic conditions and also provides alternate faster routes whenever possible, even during mid-travel.\n\n![img](9wnzib8so2y11 \"     Picture Courtesy-Infiflex \")\n\n \n\nHere are some of the benefits you can get from the new features which will become a game changer in the coming days-\n\n**Wealth of Information**\n\nGoogle Maps provides the layout of roads, the locations of towns and cities, state boundaries,  restaurant reviews, geographical features, and satellite images. It provides the Street View perspective, allowing you to see houses, storefronts and points of interest from a driver's point of view. In addition, It has indoor maps of some airports, museums and other facilities.\n\n**Sharing**\n\nUsing google maps, we can share maps with family, friends and colleagues, which makes gatherings easier to plan and coordinate. We can embed Google map information in web pages and emails and you can share maps through your Google or Facebook account.\n\n**Multiple Transportation Modes**\n\nThe Google Maps website gives you directions for trips by bike, car, foot or public transportation. The service has train and local bus schedules for many cities including bus and stop numbers and transfer points. For longer trips, it provides airline information including carriers and ticket price that serve your destination.\n\n**Demonstrates Quality**\n\nIt includes a  street view map direction is doing more than helping with the research process. It is demonstrating the quality of a business.\n\nBy providing this feature to a customer, you're showing that your business cares for its customers. And using google maps, it will do everything that can provide the best customer experience.\n\nSo, both of these aspects of the research process will increase the chances of customers visiting your business and making a purchase.\n\n**Huge Amounts Of Data**\n\nThen we have the monumental amount of data that Google has accumulated in order to provide users of Google Maps with the most complete framework with regards to other aspects of mapping. It provides things like traffic information, transit schedules, changes in city layouts, and so on. You simply have so much information to take advantage of that it barely makes sense to go with other map services.\n\nIf you are going to another country that you have never been to before, having the most up to date information on everything that goes on in the places you visit is particularly important.
