[{"id": "7nraji", "body": "Seriously Waze whomever is in charge of UX needs to be fired.  It's that bad.  If you've changed UX lead in the past few years then whomever is in charge of hiring them should also be fired.  \n\nPlease consider hiring a UX consulting team with a solid reputation to come fix your UX and then have them help you hire a competent person on your behalf.  \n\nCredit where credit is due.  You fixed this a while ago, but I don't want you to think it went unnoticed.  Thank you for getting rid of the invisible button to control the sound.  \n\nNot having invisible buttons should be a no brainer.  Thankfully that was just a nitpick not the end of the world.  It didn't make the app  unsafe. \n\nSadly, the UI you currently have is both less usable and unsafe.\n\n**The floating instruction bar in horizontal mode.**\n\nOne of the most important rules of UX design is that you do not move elements on your UI based on user input.  \n\nI.e. it is in bad form to have a button that moves when the user moves his/her mouse.   A real world example of this would be in OSX when you move your mouse towards the toolbar and the icon magnifies.  It's a nitpick in this example but it's not the end of the world.\n\nUnfortunately for your app this is more of a safety concern.  You have this floating instruction bar and the map is moving based on the vehicle's GPS data.  For all intents and purposes you're moving the floating instruction bar all over the map.  \n\nSo when I come to a stop light and need to turn left do I need to turn left immediately or in 30 feet? I can't tell because you're covering that aspect of the screen.  GPS isn't always perfectly accurate so it helps to know if I need to take the first turn or the 2nd turn.\n\nLock the tool bar to the top as it was before and we don't need to deal with this frustration again.  \n\nFinally, not having the car centered is simply in poor taste.  \n\n\n**Ads**\n\nThey pop up right on the information that I am using when I am driving.  Maybe consider having these pop up when I'm not going to have to turn in 50 feet?  That would be wonderful.  Better still maybe have them slide on the bottom and replace the bottom toolbar for a few seconds.  This way it's not ever going to be over crucial information that people are glancing at when they are performing a more risky maneuver IE turning is complicated and prone to accidents then simply driving straight.  \n\nWhile I haven't had any accidents while using this because obviously I prioritize avoiding accidents over following directions.  It's frustrating when I'm in an unfamiliar area and end up taking a wrong turn, because when I glanced at the screen to briefly get the important information I needed it was not visible to me.  \n\nPersonally I've found myself using your app less and less because it is less usable.

Hitting Go should not lead to more choices, even if there's a default after so many seconds. Those choices are available once navigation begins, anyway.\n\nThis is also annoying because if I do want to see routes, I shouldn't be on a countdown timer to choose quick or else Waze starts the trip.\n\nIn the search-initiated context, it would make more sense if the choices to see routes or share were on the destination page, and Go immediately started navigation using the default routing."}, {"id": "ds4mtd9", "body": "I totally agree with you and I will add: make the GO screen (only 1 mind you) OPTIONAL.

I say this because this was sort of my fault for taking a couple wrong turns and not trusting my gut when I should have. \n\nI was on my way back from a restaurant that\u2019s 30 minutes away from my house by using a toll road.

Instead, Waze wanted me to switch into the airport traffic lanes for my nearby airport. This is also where I messed up by not trusting my gut, because I thought Waze probably knew something that I didn\u2019t. So I switch into those lanes. \n\nWaze wanted me to get back onto the toll road that ran parallel to this lane that I was in, however this way was closed. So, Waze took me all the way to the airport and around the rented car lots and all that. At this point, I\u2019m sort of stressed out because I realized that I had essentially piggybacked off the toll road for free without going through a toll plaza, which is of course illegal. \n\nSo, I ended up home safe and sound. Waze technically did its job. However, I don\u2019t use Waze that often at all since I\u2019m young and I usually only drive short distances around my town. Because of that, I did not know I could file a map issue report. I\u2019m lucky I was not caught, but I\u2019m surprised Waze took me on a route to freeload the toll road. I do realize there\u2019s a lot of people who finesse the toll road in the exact same way though. I wish I had known better to report the map issue and to follow my gut and stay on the familiar road.\n\nTL;DR Because I was dumb, and took a wrong turn, Waze had me loop around my nearby airport, basically having me piggyback the toll road for free, which is illegal."}, {"id": "dsbjvee", "body": "Finesse used in this manner is that generation's best contribution to society."}, {"id": "dsbov6z", "body": "Just curious: do you have \"Avoid toll roads\" turned on in nav options?\n\nAnd - Dulles?\n\nThe toll enforcement there is notoriously haphazard.

All of the \"exit\" ramps back onto the Toll Road are restricted appropriately to busses/public transit.\n\nOccasional changes pop up, though.

Those yellow/orange/red/maroon stripes that get laid down when Waze wants to mark traffic on your route.\n\nIt seems like Waze assumes that traffic always starts/ends at some sort of intersection.  That's a reasonable assumption, most of the time -- heavy traffic leaves the road, or comes onto the road, or whatever.  But it seems like it's *only* and *always* at those intersections.  And when I report a legitimate \"standstill\" that's caused by some rubbernecking or an accident or whatever, this 2.5 mile stretch of road gets marked with a 9 MPH dark red stripe when in reality the jam lasts like .4 miles or something.\n\nIt'd be great if Waze either automatically segmented longer stretches for this purpose, or even better, realized that an accident might need to create an additional segment (or both, honestly)."}, {"id": "dt36y6i", "body": "Segments are usually a section of road between two intersections or where another point of entry exists. They can theoretically be made anywhere using the Waze Editor and if you are a high enough rank.\n\nThat being said, traffic is calculated by how long traffic traverses those segments. There's allowances of course for red lights but it's the average speed based on the time of day.  To your point about the jam lasting past the segment is valid. Unless the jam contributes to an overall longer exit time in that segment, you won't see it reflected on the map -- just the before part.\n\nYour first suggestion isn't all that bad really. If a slowdown is detected then add the travel time between those two segments. The one problem I see is that it would drastically increase the compute time on the servers. Think of an intersection with three possible exit points. If the accident was straight then the times between the right and left turns would be increased (but not by much) whereas the straight exit would be impacted a lot. Waze would know what estimate to give you if you programmed your route but theoretically would increase the compute by a factor of three per incident.

But today I used the lyft line option and the poor girl who I rode in with also had an address on summer st. and the driver tried to drop her in that same alleyway and she had no idea what was going on.\n\nAll I want is for waze to send people to the actual address of the building entered and not a \"close enough\" point that leaves us stranded having to walk.

I used to be involved with updating the map but once area managers started locking everything a few years ago I just quit because it's such a PITA now to get anything done. The map used to be the greatest part of Waze because it was updated so quickly. These days if I find an issue on the map, when I report it I end up trying to convince some AM that yes the city really did put a median there so now you can't turn left. I once got a response with \"well that's not showing on Google street view\" and it just blew my mind because I remember a time when using any other source was a huge no-no. Or I've found where the AM marks a turn as not allowed when it is and when I try to correct it I'm told that the map is more efficient to have that turn be not allowed. My theory had always been mark the roads as they are and let the algorithm figure it out. The AMs near me have a different idea and IMO they seem to be ruining the app. I also find them to be toxic to the community.\n\nMaybe you can reach out to your AM directly, maybe you'll have more luck than I.

I have toggled it off and on.  I have done (several) hard resets of the phone.  I am on iOS 11.3.1, and have not updated during the time that Waze stopped finding GPS.  I am not in any locations that are different.  New Vehicle is a Rogue, with Apple CarPlay.  And its own navigation.  And a Garmin Speak.  All those things find GPS just fine.  Apple Maps and Google Maps work.  It's just Waze that does not.  Additionally, Waze does not work away from the vehicle- so I don't think it can be some other GPS product interfering with Waze.

The \"We've found a better route\" feature seems to have gone away - I haven't seen it in several weeks and now I can't find it in settings.  So I find myself frequently going into the Routes list while I drive.  Sometimes a much better route is at the top of the list.

Waze and Google Maps have each shown me dozens of different ways to get from here to there and back, and both work really well (I started using Google maps recently and started wondering why Google hasn't combined the two or vastly upgraded Waze, which seems to lag behind in features).\n\nUnfortunately, I've lost a degree of confidence in both apps.\n\nThere are times when I miss a turn, or purposefully deviated from the route to a route that an app has told me to go in the past, and it forces a recalculation. That calculation usually increases the time estimate, but in a surprising number of cases (several times a week) the recalculations saves me a few minutes or as many as 10.\n\nYesterday, for example, I was close to home and GM estimated 25 minutes to home down a fairly congested two-lane highway. I took a turn onto a side road that both Waze and GM have recommended in the past, and immediately my estimate was reduced by 11 minutes. Almost 50%.\n\nSo why isn't it sending me that way in the first place? Is it a compute issue? Like they can't constantly be recalculating routes for tens of thousands of commuters? Is it a manipulation issue? Like so many people use these apps that they force some onto a slower route to avoid congestion on other routes?\n\nDuring any given commute, the route will recalculate and give me a faster route (it's rare, but happens more often with Waze).

I could be totally wrong about this but I thought it was worth posting in case somebody knows more.  OTOH i've heard it will sometimes route you on a path it wants, but does not have, data on.  If its collecting data on who blindly follows Waze  and using that data to decide whom to send on those data-getting routes, I'm almost surely that person. \n\nI have seen this shorter time after recalculating and it makes me loose faith in the fastest route.

I had driven westward from one end of the parking lot to the other. When I told it to navigate to a point east of my location, it simply started my route at a point on the road closest to my current location and said, \"Please proceed to highlighted route.\" In this case, Waze would have assumed I was headed westward on the road, and would have calculated an unnecessarily circuitous route.\n\nWith Google maps, I tested a corner parking lot that is not mapped, using the same parameters. I got two different routes, depending on where I was in the parking lot. Each started on the closest point on the road to my current location, and routed in the proper direction. In the first of the two images, the navigation started on a road that doesn't actually connect to the parking lot, but that's okay, because I can see the route, I can see where I am in relation to the route, and I can get myself onto one of the connecting roads headed in the right direction.

If it wants to change its mind on what is the best route while I'm halfway there, I'd prefer if it just reroutes me and gives me the next direction. That distracts me less as a driver. I know it will get me there, so I would rather I just trust it than it bothers me.\n\nWhen consumer car GPS first became a thing, when you went off its route it used to say \"recalculating. ... recalculating... recalculating...\" and beep, then it might bring up the new route, or (depending on what brand and model) it might put a button up for you to press to confirm it. This used to make drivers *nuts*, because you'd miss one turn and it'd start saying \"recalculating\" over and over again. People would scream at their GPS. Finally the GPS companies learned that they shouldn't make it say anything, they should just make it recalculate silently and give you the next direction. Suddenly drivers were much happier.\n\nIf I miss a turn and don't know it, the GPS won't give me a long winded explanation of this fact, it will just do its thing to get me on track, and I won't necessarily know anything happened.

However, depending on how the intersection has been mapped out, this learning process may not work as well as it ought to, in which case the map data can be modified to help Waze learn better.\n\nSo the short answer is that, yes, there possibly is something that can be done to improve routing at this location, and the best way forward would be to bring this intersection to the notice of the local editors, either by submitting a map issue report at the location, or by posting about it in the relevant local area forum on the Waze website."}, {"id": "e3dbl11", "body": "I too wish there was such a feature.

Unless you're already familiar with the editing side of Waze, then you're best off just reporting this area for others to do the detailed investigation work...\n\nI'm guessing from your use of language that you're somewhere in North America, which isn't a part of the world I'm particularly familiar with as far as the Waze editing community goes - I'm the other side of the pond in the UK, and here it'd be unusual for reports of problems in major areas to go untouched for extended periods of time.  I do know that the NA community is pretty active across the continent, but due to the sheer size of the area covered, they do struggle to keep on top of reports.  But even so, I'd still not expect them to go untouched for the sort of timescales you're describing here.\n\nHave you had *any* sort of feedback to any of your reports?  One thing to bear in mind (which IIRC isn't made clear in the wording Waze use) is that the email which gets sent to the reporting user whenever an editor responds to the report, is only to let you know about the reply.  If you then try responding to the email itself, as would seem to be the obvious thing to do, rather than via the inbox within the Waze app, your email gets silently ditched by the Waze mail server without ever being seen by the editor who responded.  \n\nSo if you do get a response which is asking for further details to help the editor understand the problem, it's vital to reply via the app in order for your reply to get back to the editor.\n\n\nBut tbh, if it's a problem that has the potential to require some back and forth discussion, provision of photos or other supporting evidence etc, then going via the forums is so much easier, and if your local editing community is as active in the forums as we are over here, it gives your problem a very good chance of being seen by someone who understands what the problem is and has the necessary editing rights to do something about  it."}, {"id": "e3dsxf7", "body": "I've seen Waze tout this feature and I think it is vaporware.

"}, {"id": "e3dv81k", "body": "If it's not really a better way and Waze is not learning, it may be because of some esoteric mapping issues. \n\nWaze records transitional times on segments at the junction node of each road.  This is usually really accurate but can be messed up when there are junction nodes before an intersection that backs up regularly before those intermediary nodes.  For example a node not far before an intersection for a side road to go into a gas station or other parking lot can pollute the data if there's a lot of right turns that don't wait for the light much.  It averages out the movement across that node to turn into the parking lot between left, right, and straight turns a little bit further up and hence under-represents the time taken to make the left turn or go straight.\n\nThis is really common in areas that have long stacks of cars waiting to get through a light.  \n\nA higher ranking editor can fix this if they know about it. \n\nIf you want to PM me where this is I can have a look for you.  \n\nps, as far as not getting responses on map reports, that really depends on the area.  For example, New York City generates hundreds of reports a day and it's hard for volunteers to keep up with them.   Usually people who work on them also live in that area.

In simpler cases it's a matter of just redesigning the intersection a little bit.   I've created a few in my state where they are warranted.  \n\nFor example, a typical box intersection where two divided highways meet, let's say you are coming from the south and heading west. The left and straight movements both go straight over the first junction at the lower right in the square, then the left goes left at the top right of the box. So the nearest junction node at the bottom right where people wait for the light only sees traffic going right and straight.   Real left and straight traffic there gets counted together in that node.  If the left turns have a longer red light or get backed up where you have to wait more than one light cycle, that gets averaged in to that node with straight traffic so left turns don't count as long but straight movements are assumed longer than they are. \n\nBut that can be fixed without a junction box too. \n\nAre you an editor?

I\u2019ve tried powering down and turning back on the phone, turning airplane mode on/off and resetting network settings and they were all temporary fixes if they worked at all. The solution that I\u2019ve found that works best for me when I really need to rely on the GPS is that I have to turn off LTE. So I currently am using iOS 11.4.1 and go to Settings&gt;Cellular&gt;Cellular Data Options&gt;Enable LTE&gt;Off and then it will turn off the LTE radio antenna or something and go to the 4G network. Download speed sucks, but the gps doesn\u2019t get lost every 5 minutes.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve considered jumping to the Android platform since the issues have become worse and worse. I went from the original Samsung Galaxy S to the iPhone 5 and then to the 6s. The appeal to me was that between the OEM and the Cell service network providers here in the USA, there was no advantage to release android OS updates or it became finger pointing by different companies as to why phone software updates would get held up for one reason or another and the end user would be left holding the bag. \n\nPissed off, I jumped to the iPhone because they didn\u2019t have issues with getting OS updates. I also naively thought that with less handset models to adapt OS and software to since Apple controls the hardware and software, that I would have a superior experience as the end user. Well somewhere along the way, somebody has fucked up. I know it\u2019s not just me, but many iPhone users that have GPS and Cell connection problems. Between the service provider and Apple, who else is there to pass the buck/accountability on to since they control everything. How does this happen? A simple google search, YouTube search, or Reddit search amongst iPhone subreddits will reveal that many users have experienced these same problems and even developers in Apple discussion forums that are working with iOS 12 are already having problems. Again, Apple and ATT are the only people that can be blamed, right? And Apple controls the hardware and software and yet there seems to be no solution or fix in sight nor an official acknowledgement of widespread issues. It\u2019s bullshit and those two companies know it and say nothing. They are both complicit with a shitty user experience as they lean back and count their money. What good is a connected smart device - if it\u2019s not connected? If I don\u2019t see something change, I\u2019ll go to the Android handset for my next phone. They have dropped the ball here. The incentive of paying a premium for the iPhone experience has diminished significantly when the antennas, gps and software lose function or don\u2019t work together.

I don\u2019t see any relation to time of day or location as to when the problems hit. I will also had that I don\u2019t use the Bluetooth radio regularly and keep it turned off.

Most people want to avoid them for that reason because they don't want to buy a year-pass for 1-day and only a few kilometers. There was no way to get a full route with those parameters and you had to change your \"avoid tolls\" settings while on route.\n\n\\- With the change **this is how it works now**: Choose whether you want to avoid/allow toll roads (for countries using physical toll booths) in general, and setup your toll sticker passes before leaving to get routed only where you want. From Germany to Austria you can simply add the pass called \"Vignette AT\" and to avoid Switzerland simply do not add the \"Vignette CH\" pass, Waze will know that you don't plan to buy or don't have the Swiss sticker and will avoid routing you through roads where that sticker is required."}, {"id": "e4itvky", "body": "This is why split roads are terrible to be used in the editor.

I'm sure what happens to me or my town won't be the same for everyone, but here's what I'm noticing.\n\nLong time Wazer, back to almost when it started, but not a beta tester or anything like that.  What I've noticed, however, is that now that Waze &amp; Google Maps has gotten so popular, and everyone and I mean EVERYONE is using it now....when an incident occurs on the main route into our downtown area during rush hour, for example, Waze directs you to an alternate route.  This used to work great.  However, I've noticed with its popularity (comes great responsibility, heh) the alternate route method has become almost unusable. I say that because the moment it tells EVERYONE to use the alternative route, that alternative route instantly becomes the worst decision you could ever make.  It literally becomes a complete standstill of epic proportions. And what usually happens is, after sitting in that epic movelessness (invented a word) for 20-30 minutes, at some point it will end up saying a faster route has been found, which ends up being getting back to the original route.  So lately, I'm almost at the point to now not trust these alternative route suggestions anymore, and just stick with the original route irregardless of the fact right now it's backed up due to an accident, or whatever.  Because it will undoubtedly become the better decision, anyhow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why this post?  Well, for feedback and discussion, I guess.  Just an observation.  And I guess, how can Waze &amp; Google Maps, etc, combat this?  Can they create an algorithm or program their GPS to maybe proportionately allocate alternative routes to all of its users that aren't the exact same alternative route?  Or any other ideas?  Because right now as I see it, they are basically just creating new traffic jams wherever they are sending everyone, now that they are so immensely popular and everyone just depends on them to go anywhere."}, {"id": "e4p7v1t", "body": "First things first... what city/region are you in?

But that's beyond the point.  The alternate roads to the main expressway getting everyone across town into the downtown area, are in no way comparable for the same amount of traffic.  They weren't designed for that purpose.  But there are ***several*** of them that could handle the split.  The problem is GPS sends ALL its users down that SAME one alternate route causing a massive traffic jam, worse than the original route.  It only changes the alternate route when it sees a ton of users now in a complete standstill.  And by the time that happens, it's usually trying to get you back to the original route it made you avoid, because the accident has been cleared up or whatever.\n\nI also know someone who reports traffic from the air for local media, who has confirmed not since more recently has he seen an alternate route pile up so quickly in a matter of minutes.

I drove with the app on daily, made map edits, and marked every car stopped along side the road, big pothole and cop. So, I'm really confused why an app that was so great is now suffering a noticeable, steep decline in function and quality.\n\nTell me if I'm off base here or if I'm the only person experiencing these issues:\n\nDrive sharing: You can still share a destination with \"friends\" but they no longer see your live location and an accurate ETA.  My only regular Waze friend is my wife, and we use it know who will get home from work first (and take out the dog).  I used to know exactly where on her route she was and when she'd be home to the minute.  Now, I'll receive a notification that she's on her way home or to a store or whatever, but when I click on her in my friends menu it just gives her destination- the map doesn't show her live location anymore and the ETA is wrong- the ETA always shows the current time.  She could be driving an hour to work, and I know she's still a half hour away and the ETA will say the current time.  \n\nRouting around traffic: I usually take the interstate to and from work everyday, but there is an alternate route using a parallel rural US highway that would usually be about an extra 5 to 10 minutes longer.  I cannot count how many days this year I turned on Waze in my parking lot at work, it sent me home via the Interstate, and then a couple minutes later I found myself stuck in construction.  If I had only known about the construction and slowdown, I would have taken the US highway and been home way faster.  Waze apparently didn't catch that.\n\n There are a couple other issues too that I won't harp on, but it's just frustrating that something I used every day doesn't work as well as it did four years ago.  Am I the only one?  I'm on Android and my wife is an Apple person and has the same issues.  \n\nIs there another app out there with the same features but actually functions?

It often gets backed up but often those backups are fairly fluid and move around and hot spots are short lived.   Now I'll often get Waze wanting me to detour through local streets in Bethesda area.  When it provides me with the detour, it's probably true that that route is faster NOW.  However, if it provides that detour to everyone else on the beltway, then traffic on the beltway drops and heavy traffic begins on the local streets as all the Waze users start following the detour.\n\nSo sometimes you have to use your best judgement and decide what to do.  \n\nBy the way, one thing I do is if I'm given a detour I try to swipe up on the map to look ahead. If I see reports of an accident then it's most likely unusual traffic, like closed lanes or even stopped traffic. In that case detouring is probably a good thing.

If something isn't visible in the latest streetview imagery then it might as well not exist as far as GMaps is concerned.  You can spend as much time as you like gathering your own evidence of the existence of the changes, but with no obvious way to provide that evidence to Google then they take one look at the details they do allow you to enter via the standard change request form, compare it to what they already know, and quietly reject without any request for further information...  OTOH, you can fire up WME and (editing rights permitting) map out an entire new build estate for Waze in a matter of hours, and then see it made available in the app a few days later.\n\nI do like GMaps as a general purpose mapping tool, but unless they take user submissions of changes to the map data more seriously, and give us the ability to easily validate what we're saying has changed with photos, GPS track data etc, then the entirely crowd sourced approach to map maintenance that Waze have adopted will always win out in the end for anyone who cares that the map they're using right here and now is as up to date as it can possibly be.

"}, {"id": "e77he1i", "body": "To expand on the previous answer slightly...  Yes, *if* it knows about them *and* there's an alternative route it's also aware of which looks to be a better choice at the time.\n\nBear in mind that, unlike Google Maps navigation which is being fed with realtime traffic data from pretty much everyone in the area with an active Android phone, even if they're not using it for navigation, Waze gets data only from people actively using Waze.  \n\nIf you're in an area with a high concentration of users, the realtime traffic data will then be on a par with Google's data, and  Waze's ability to route around traffic will seem like magic.  In areas with fewer users however, it can often seem like Waze is the dumbest navigator on the planet and will quite happily let you join the end of a lengthy traffic jam it simply wasn't aware of.\n\nIt may also look like it's not working if, despite showing the traffic jam onscreen, it still routes you into the back of it rather than taking you on a different route.  Usually when this happens, it's either because the alternate route really is slower even without any traffic, or is also clogged up with traffic that Waze knows about but just hasn't shown on screen yet, and so sitting through the jam will then still get you to your destination faster than going another route even though it might not feel like it at the time...  \n\nOne thing Waze doesn't however seem to to very well is to try and predict any further build up of traffic due to the jam it already knows about - e.g. if there's been an accident up ahead, this might currently only be adding a 5 minute delay at the point you join the back of the queue, but then 5 minutes later you're still stuck in the queue having not yet reached the point of the accident, because now the emergency services have arrived and closed off another lane to start recovery, or because the traffic ahead of you has just slowed down even more due to idiots rubbernecking instead of paying attention to the road ahead.  So there are times when it knows full well about what the current delay is for drivers who've just passed through the area, but where the actual delay to you as you just join onto the back of the queue can be considerably higher.\n\nBut then there are times when it all works out better than predicted, because you've joined the queue just as it starts to clear again, so the estimated delay is considerably longer than your actual journey time...  So in my experience, the more you use Waze and place your trust in its routing decisions, the more likely you are to end up saving time overall."}, {"id": "9llr9d", "body": "Hello.

There are times when it goes down and Waze will route through the closures.  Normally there's no way to know this happened other than as an editor seeing a ton of angry reports about being routed through closures during the time.  \n\nB) The default behavior for a closure is for Waze to route through it if it detects traffic passing through it.  This is a big problem in particular for roads that parallel another road, such as off ramps.  Waze may think cars on the open road are on the closed road, leading Waze to route through it.

When you see multiple report markers in close proximity, this suggests they're being made by users on different roads (e.g. clusters of reports around a junction, over/underpass etc) or the other side of a divided road, such that their reports are being associated with a different road segment in the map data and not therefore combined with the reports nearby on other segments.\n\nFor the reporting option not to be present at all usually means that the app has either not initialised itself properly, or that those types of reports have now been blocked in the area you're travelling.\n\nOTOH, if the app is still letting you submit reports and they're genuinely not showing up on the map at all (as opposed to being combined with another report a bit further away as noted above, which can make it sometimes appear that your report hasn't been accepted) then it's probably just a random glitch with your app and/or the servers.\n\nOTotherOH, Waze can also implement user-specific blocks on making certain types of report if that user has been flagged for some reason.  As far as I know, when this happens you should receive an email to your registered Waze email (or possibly a message in your app inbox - I'm not 100% on the method of notification, just that one does exist) letting you know about the block and giving some instructions on how to go about getting it removed."}, {"id": "eaa3vox", "body": "Works fine for me "}, {"id": "eaf7j6y", "body": "I know how waze works.

Secondary (but probably related) that planned drives are not being populated from calendar.\n\n**Troubleshooting**: Calendars are selected, all relevant permissions granted to Waze. Waze recognizing addresses. Will receive occasional notification if Waze had recently been opened.\n\n**Possible Cause**: Google's new adaptive battery, but more specifically, the bucket system it employs ([read more here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power)). \n\n**Possible Solution**: Manually assign Waze app to \"Active\" bucket. \n\n1. Follow these instructions [https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/](https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/)\n2. Go to the Waze app and select Active\n\n**Phone Details:** Verizon Pixel 3, 128 gb, December update of Android 9\n\n**Narrative:**\n\nI have found adaptive battery to be beneficial (or at least not harmful) in maintaining my battery life, so I didn't necessary want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. But, I believe this to be a proximal cause of the Waze issue. In a little Saturday morning internet researching, I stumbled across the bucket system for adaptive battery ([link again here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power)). So the way I interpret Adaptive Battery is that based on the user's interaction with various applications (and, perhaps importantly, notifications), the system will assign apps into various buckets, ranging from \"this person never really uses this so keep it in check\", to, \"this person uses this all the time, don't mess with it\". \n\nFor me, I don't use Waze for navigation or anything else other then it's feature of telling me when I should leave before an event to get there on time. That is one of the crown jewels for my metric of a personal assistant. However, my use of Waze may be causing resources to be managed such that I don't receive those occasional notifications I desire. \n\nSo, to cut to the chase, I manually assigned Waze into the \"Active\" bucket so that adaptive battery would be nicer to it. And so far, it is working like a charm (for the last 3+ days). Now, please note: **Google does not consider what I have done as a \"Best Practice\"**, because I am not allowing the algorithm to do it's thing. And perhaps there are unintended consequences from what I've done. But I think that a tool is supposed to be helpful, otherwise it's a waste of time. \n\n[These very nice instructions](https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/) will guide you through the process.

I was a map editor when we were still adding some of the main roads. I\u2019ve been high status, low status and everything in between. With that said, recently I\u2019ve started using other apps and here is why:\n\n1. Navigation issues. Using Waze on my daily commute is great 95% of the time. It finds great routes and gets me around most traffic. Recently though I\u2019ve been seeing more and more routing errors. Near my house it sometimes redirects me around the block instead of the obvious straight shot. I checked and fixed a map error and it went away, but then suddenly came back about two months ago. It doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to have to continually fix something so basic.\n2. Too long to get status back. So, in order to fix that one issue above, I had to spend two months earning back my map editing status. That was two months of adding parking lots so that my edits could be trusted again. Even though I worked on some of the first maps, I had lost my status as I didn\u2019t remain a constant map editor. It\u2019s not a reasonable expectation to have a part time job simply to fix my routing software.\n3. No easy way to report map errors. Ok, I know what you are thinking, you should have just reported it and had another editor fix it. Unfortunately, the new Apple Play app doesn\u2019t have that feature anymore (or I couldn\u2019t find it, especially while driving). I did report it the first time, but the map backlog was so bad, it took weeks for someone to look at it. That\u2019s why I went through the effort of getting basic status back.\n4. Too many silly reports. I listen to other things while I commute. I also live in Vegas, so our roads are pretty good especially in comparison to cities that get snow. A few times a month, someone will feel the need to report every wrinkle in the road as a pothole. That means my entire commute is riddled with \u201cpothole ahead\u201d warnings. So annoying.\n5. Better features on other apps. I\u2019ve stumbled into a few other apps out of frustration and found lots of features that Waze simple doesn\u2019t have. This includes lane selection navigation and automatic route recalculation and suggestion. It seems like Waze is falling behind.\n\nNow, there are some things I do miss. These include:\nA. Traffic reports - it\u2019s very helpful to know that the slowdown is a crash, object in road, or simply traffic.\nB. Actual road hazards - now I do thing the \u201cgame of reporting\u201d encourages silly reports like phantom potholes or cars fully off the road reported as cars on the shoulder. But knowing there is an object on the road is very helpful.\nC. Police reports - I think a lot of these are \u201cI saw a cop driving\u201d, but it is helpful when you see several reports in an area, so you know they are trolling for tickets between Trop and Charleston.\n\nAnyone else straying from the fold?"}, {"id": "ebzhev1", "body": "Re #1 - I think Waze is assuming that everybody uses on street parking at home and needs to enter and leave the same direction - that's why they route you around the block to come home, or when leaving.

What they don't seem to know is that I really pulled into my driveway, and the 2/3 block is the long way and doesn't make sense...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4 - as much as possible give the thumbs down/cancel to the silly reports. Users who make silly reports that get downvoted do receive a different status and their reports become less weighted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2-#3 - I get it. They restructured the map editor points last year sometime and almost everyone got bumped back to L1. Most map editor groups moved to Discord, and the groups I'm familiar with are very active, and also accepting and helpful to lower level editors. You make an unlock request on a particular area, then you can edit/fix, then they will review the edits before re-locking the area. They do this because low level map editors were going around editing things poorly without following some guidelines which are pretty important to follow...  so just find your regional map editors group and ask for an unlock, then you should be able to edit safely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPolice reports and road hazards from what I understand need to be reported by more than one person before they will appear on the map for others, to prevent someone from clogging the map with reports.

If Waze knows you are going to remain traveling east, it'll warn you about said cop half a mile in advance.  However, if between that point and the cop, there are intersections, how does it know you aren't going to turn?  So it waits until you pass the last intersection before alerting, which may be much less than half a mile from the alert location.  Same thing if you ARE going to turn... if there's a cop on a street heading south, for instance, Waze doesn't know you're gonna turn until you do.  So it may not be able to give you enough advanced warning to react to the alert.\n\nIn general, it's best to always route yourself to your destination, even if you know where you're going.  Not only does it make the alerts more timely as explained above, but it also allows the system to re-route you around traffic or other hazards.

I have a friend with an apartment near campus that I stay with one or two nights a week so I don't do the drive every single weekday, but I do it most of the time.  Whenever I drive to and from there, I've been plugging either the campus address or my home address into Waze, and at times it works well, and other times, it has put me right onto the Cross Bronx into some of the worst traffic I've ever sat in.  It eventually reroutes me out of it, such as diverting me to the lower level of the GWB when it originally had me going the upper level, but I feel like it shouldn't be throwing me into traffic that bad in the first place.  I live in the very northern part of Bergen County, on the border of Rockland, so I am about an equal distance from the TZ Bridge as the GW, if not even a little closer.  One time, Waze took me from my house to Fordham over the TZ, and I didn't have to stop the car once except at red lights and I got there in 40 mins.  Meanwhile, last night, I left campus around 10pm, put on Waze as always, and it threw me onto the Cross Bronx, where I sat still for about 45 mins.  Once I actually reached the beginning of the bridge, traffic started moving along, but the approach was a nightmare.  There is no way the TZ route would have been jammed like that at that hour of the night, am I right?  I didn't get home until close to midnight.  Tomorrow morning I am not planning on using Waze at all and simply taking the TZ.  It is a longer distance, but worth it to get rid of the headache.  Anyway, sorry for my rant, but has Waze been doing this for anybody else lately?  This app is supposed to route me around traffic, not right into it.

Sometimes sitting in a parking lot-like \"road\" for 45 minutes will get you to your destination *faster* than alternative routes.\n\nRemember, too:  Waze can give you multiple route options before you start.

Sometimes computers get wonky and just need to be power cycled.  \nYou've already done that, so we move to the next step. Uninstall Waze, do ANOTHER POWER CYCLE (to clear anything out of memory), power back up, and reinstall Waze. Make sure you log out and log back in, that apparently matters to Waze.  \n\nAfter that, if Waze still doesn't work, check another service/application that uses GPS. Try Google Maps, or something along those lines:  \nIf other applications ARE working fine, and it's just Waze, check your permissions and settings. Waze doesn't access the GPS circuitry in each phone directly, but rather asks the operating system where it thinks it is, and it needs permission to get that information. I can't tell you exactly how to do this, as it varies from phone to phone, but it's in settings somewhere. Waze wants access to your microphone, contacts, and location, and each of those can be turned on or off.  \nIf other applications ARE NOT working, make sure location services are turned on for your phone (so your phone knows where it is, and can offer that information to apps). Again, I can't tell you exactly how to do this, as it varies from phone to phone, but it's in settings somewhere.  \n\nIf all that doesn't work, and ONLY Waze can't get GPS, it's possible that the operating system has gone corrupt, in which case, reloading the whole phone is fix (not fun). If nothing can get GPS, and a reload doesn't fix it, it's possible the hardware has gone faulty too, in which case, replacement phone is the only feasible answer."}, {"id": "egfdzix", "body": "I have a Samsung Note8"}, {"id": "egfld2t", "body": "OK.

Install the app, and activate your GPS.\n\nIf your phone is working well, and if you are not inside an area that has poor GPS reception, you should see a signal within a few seconds.  You will also be able to see a map of the GPS satellites.  AND there will be a link to push to update your AGPS.\n\n(AGPS is used to get GPS locations faster, by scanning nearby cell towers to approximate your location).\n\nIf it takes a long time to get a GPS signal, there may be a hardware problem with your phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "aq83oi", "body": "I almost feel like the NYPD thing has gotten national attention, so other police forces are trying to cloud the waters.

Believe me, if I had a pound/dollar/[insert local currency equivalent here] every time my wife complained about Waze sending her off down a back street rat run just to shave a few minutes off the more obvious route along the main roads, I'd lost have enough cash to buy Waze back off of Google...\n\nSeriously though, some of us really don't want to be directed through weird back routes unless the route we'd usually take is *so* badly screwed up that it really would be crazy to use it.  Every time I head to or from work, I have to double check to see *why* Waze wants to take me a certain route if it isn't the one I'd prefer to take, because whilst I can safely ignore it 99% of the time as it's just trying to save me 5 minutes, there's always that 1% where ignoring it would leave me heading blissfully unaware straight into the traffic from hell caused by a major accident, emergency roadworks etc.\n\nSo if Waze could be persuaded to give us more control over route selection (remember the good old days when they used to claim to learn our favourite routes...) and not just assume that we all prioritise shorter journey times over all else, that'd be something which a lot of users really would benefit from.

I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to stop using Waze 100%, but I definitely use it less than I did. Oh, and I didn\u2019t even mention the fact that some of the other apps are use had incessant pop pop ups every single time I would login or go to a new screen asking me if I wanted to connect Waze, and this was after I went through all the settings to make sure Waze was not connected to my other apps."}, {"id": "ejlsqxt", "body": "Wow!!

HOWEVER, count the actions you have to take from there. For me to mute, unmute, or get alerts only, there are FOUR actions/clicks I have to do that take me out of navigation before being returned to navigation. Again, this simple audio change takes you out of navigation. And you actually have to CHOOSE to resume your route to get back. \n\nThen, if I need the audio navigation and also want to change from bluetooth to iphone speaker (if I\u2019m listening to the radio for example, so Bluetooth isn\u2019t enabled on my car audio at the moment), I have to go BACK in, as a second set of steps, and click about 3 things, then again click resume to get back to navigation. Because when you change your audio sound level preference, that window doesn\u2019t stay open for you to also adjust your speaker preference. It just closes automatically. And even though that window closes automatically, somehow it\u2019s not even intuitive enough to take you straight back to navigation if it\u2019s going to close but instead leaves another window open over the map and requires you to hit \u201cResume\u201d to get back to navigation. \n\nLet\u2019s even go to the example of what happened to me yesterday with the actual navigation. I was trying to be routed specifically to an HOV entrance lane, which Waze had offered me at the beginning of my trip as an option. It then updated for another route that it said would be quicker, which I knew wasn\u2019t. OK fine. I had someone else in the car with me and I wanted to take the HOV. So I went back to look at the alternate routes to change it back the HOV preference to continue going that way, Since I wasn\u2019t sure where the exact entrance was and didn\u2019t want to miss it. Waze then no longer offered the HOV as one of the three alternate options. I literally had to restart my route (closing out the app and/or going back in to alternate routes) no less than 10 times to be able to get the HOV option again. And yes, that option was the fastest one, and yet WAZE wasn\u2019t offering it as one of the three routes to take 8 times out of 10. And yes, even though there\u2019s no option to adjust HOV preference, I did have toll roads enabled in settings.\n\nI don\u2019t get how that\u2019s acceptable for an app at this level. And given the amount of distracting ads that are constantly popping up every time I stop for half a second and the fact that I\u2019m being cross marketed to across other apps I use without requesting it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s expecting too much for it to be better.

I am having trouble finding a good thread on this. \nI understand the morality issues some people may have with taking pictures of cops to report for the app. Some of you may say its our right to report and take picture of, but I am unsure on my actual rights on this. \nSay I am driving around safely and I see a cop in a hidden-ish location. Say I turn around legally, pull into the lot across from the cop/or the same lot as the cop, legally turn off my car and take a picture for the app to post. I would never take a pic of the cops face, simply the location and the car clearly. Any problems here?\n\nSo clearly that was me. From there, the cop came to talk with me. Asked me why I took a pic, I explained it was for waze and I did not include his face. He was shocked, and took my plate down for whatever reason. I rationalized it as he was checking if im a hazard after our talk, which I think makes sense. I was let go, he was not aggressive, he didnt really care, was just shocked though. To clarify, I was never detained. He never implied detaining me, he was just having a cop conversation with me. \n\nI personally kind of regret doing it because yknow cops are people too and all. But that cop was near my house and I know for a fact that people slamming on their brakes at that spot causes a lot of confusion and I was surprised the cops dont understand their impact on safe driving by hiding and scaring grandmas on an open road.\n\nI was treated kindly and with respect, as I believe most cops would do in that situation. However, if I continue to do this, I believe at some point I may just get a cop on a bad day or something. Its bound to happen. If a cop really wanted to get me for something if I did this, is there anything he could (not morally/correctly/legally) do? \n\nTLDR: in the northeast us, are there any laws preventing me from going out of my way to take cop pics for waze?

After the car icon, but before the noise, my car's air conditioner turns to a low setting, and then turns back up after the noise plays. I think it is doing this because it thinks I am using Siri or dictating, and my car has a feature that automatically turns down the air to reduce the noise in the car during dictation.\n\nThere have been no software updates to my car in over 3 years, so I do not think the problem is with my car software. It seems most likely to be related to a recent Waze or iOS update.\n\nI have tried disabling Waze access to Siri and to the microphone, but those don't seem to do anything. Making the audio play through the phone speaker instead of bluetooth does fix the problem, but then the navigation prompts are quiet and I'd prefer to do it through the car speakers.\n\nAlso, if I am playing music or a podcast while navigating, the issue does not happen. I think in that situation Waze just plays through bluetooth audio, rather than pretending to be a phone call, so that is probably why it works.

I take the 528 every morning and pay no tolls. Yet the same road has tolls in and around Orlando. This is why I think that Waze and Google Maps fail to recognize these roads as toll roads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in Orlando, you'll see that every road is a toll road, except for 441 and 192. The sign says \"Toll 528\" and \"Toll 592\" (if I remember correctly). It is a play to force you to get EZ Pass. Basically, if you do not have EZ Pass, you are charged an additional \"administrative fee\" because someone had to automate a non-EZ-Pass solution. It's not that someone had to manually labor -- but it's somehow inconvenient to them that you didn't buy EZ-Pass. To the tune of $4.95, if I remember correctly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI refuse to buy Sun Pass and EZ Pass, because the whole VIP society stinks. We already pay sales tax anyways and the roads are supposed to be free. And, of course, they ARE free, if you get off the Turnpike ($3.25 is reasonable from Wildwood to Orlando), you have to go to 441, down to 192 and then across to Melbourne.

What's worse, there's a nearby one-lane bridge just uphill and Waze routes tractor-trailer trucks along with all the other traffic down into \"the hole\" where it then requires local police to stop traffic so the drivers can back their rigs uphill around the bend and back across the narrow one-lane bridge, a maneuver that can block the road for hours.\n\nHow someone driving a U-Haul truck can blindly follow Waze or Google Maps and ignore flashing warning signs and crash into iron beams erected to protect an old wooden bridge simply can't be explained, it's not a rational act, yet it happens with increasing regularity - at least once a month now.\n\nWhy can't we simply get Waze to remove our beloved wooden bridge from their routing algorithms and detour traffic on nearby Hurt Road? The frequent collisions and backups are a major public expense and safety hazard, and an embarrassment to our community and to Waze/Google Maps. What's worse, the Waze routing was initially correctly blocked at the covered bridge (no through truck traffic, severe height and weight restrictions), but a routing override was entered into the Waze database after several months.\n\nWe can't even get Waze to provide drivers with a warning that they're approaching a 7'0\" height restriction, yet they nag us well in advance about scraps of truck tires along the side of the freeways.\n\nThere is no good reason for this, only excuses.

As such, we can map out restrictions which apply to private cars, taxis and motorbikes, but there's no way to control routing for other types of vehicle such as trucks, other than to prevent routing for all types of vehicle.\n\nGiven the focus of Waze on these specific types of road user, you'll then generally find that the local/national map editing policies are to include any road that is useable by these vehicles in order to give these users the best routing experience - users will be only too quick to complain if they realise Waze refuses to use a road that they know they could be using and which would save them time.\n\nI appreciate there's an issue with idiot drivers of larger vehicles ignoring all the warning signs here (as happens far too often in far too many similar locations around the world), but this isn't specifically a Waze problem - many general purpose satnav systems will assume the user is driving an average sized vehicle capable of using most/all of the roads in its mapping database, and there is a parallel market for satnav systems specifically designed around the needs of larger vehicle drivers, with mapping data that includes width/height/weight restrictions.  Not surprisingly, such systems tend to be more expensive than the general purpose systems, and infinitely more expensive than free solutions such as Waze or Google, and so some truck drivers choose not to invest in these systems...  \n\nFinally, please bear in mind that the Waze map data is entirely maintained by volunteers as a crowdsourced effort, and appealing to Waze themselves will therefore be of little use as they don't have any direct involvement here."}, {"id": "eoiygvh", "body": "Commercial trucking should not be using Waze for navigation, period.

Waze does have community outreach groups who can set up a local 'official' to manage roads and scheduled construction closures in their area.

The type of person who ignores that many warning signs will not be deterred by any combination of signs, computer program changes, or even legal restrictions. Your only realistic bet is to physically prevent the over height vehicles from reaching the bridge.

In some cars/applications, it manifests itself as an inaccuracy to both GPS position and actual speed derived from change in GPS position of the Ford Sync module.\n\nApple CarPlay gets its actual speed information from the head unit's GPS system (I guess its one of their hardware specifications that manufacturers have to implement for CarPlay), but since Waze is the only phone-based navigation app that has a feature showing actual speed (Apple Maps and Google Maps I think do not), the problem with inaccurate speeds only manifests itself when the Speed Limit feature is enabled on Waze and Waze is connected to a Ford Sync 3 head unit with Apple CarPlay. \n\nThe native app on the phone will work fine, as will Ford Sync's direct (SDL) integration with Waze (since that integration relies on the phone's GPS for location and actual speed).\n\nAccording to both Waze and Apple, there is nothing either can do to fix it, nor does Apple provide any option switches to override this information with information from the phone's GPS. Rather, both say that Ford must patch/fix/replace the Sync unit so that it delivers the correct information to Apple CarPlay, which Waze then uses and displays.\n\nSadly, I've had to completely disable the Speed Limit feature in Waze because the problem is that annoying in my 2018 Ford Escape. Both my Ford dealer and Sync technical support acknowledge that many Sync 3 head units have been reported to have similar issues with GPS, but as of now, there is no fix/patch/update available for it, nor would anyone speak to whether it would or could be updated with a patch (as opposed to requiring a hardware replacement). From the limited research I have done, it looks like the problems have to do with recently-changed GPS specifications to accommodate the shifting magnetic poles, and it could very well be likely that the generation of GPS hardware used in many of our cars will never be able to correctly support this function again.

On the way down, using the Samsung, I was able to get an instant speed lock. On the way back, the iPhone would only get a speed if I was sitting next to the window and placed my phone against it, and sometimes it took 10-15 minutes until it was able to get a satellite lock. \n\nThe iPhone also takes about 30 seconds to get my location when I drive out of my apartments parking garage, but the Samsung would have my location as soon as android auto was running. \n\nThe gps works, it\u2019s just not as good as it could be."}, {"id": "er2mnzw", "body": "Sorry no, never had an Android phone but I frequently use a long tunnel under a river and my iPhone picks me up very quickly as soon as I have sky above me not concrete and bedrock"}, {"id": "er3afgx", "body": "Sorry, yes.

They all suck, all of them.  They can only be used as a general assistant, but are not to be relied on for any real intelligence.  Let me count the ways in which they suck:\n\n* They will always send you through the busiest arteries of a city without dare considering a side street.  Yesterday, nav was telling me to take streets with 2 minute delays at traffic lights while the side streets were wide open.  Even with stop signs, there was no one on them.  I cruised through the neighborhood without delay by ignoring nav.\n* They'll tell you to zig zag through multiple left turns.  For example, let's say you're going due northeast at a roughly 45 degree angle to your destination.  Instead of taking Street A due north, turning right at Street B, and continuing straight onto my destination, these stupid apps will think it's somehow better to go east one block, turn left for a block, then right again, then left again.  It's as if there's no concept of left turns taking longer or being more dangerous.  Do the people programming this think they've saved me any time or carved out any real distance savings?  Their route takes longer anyway!\n* Sometimes they're just absurd.  One time I was in Buellton, CA, adjacent to a highway entrance/exit, going to Pea Soup Andersons.  Nav wanted me to get on a highway, go north to the next exit, turn left, go over the highway, turn left again, and head back towards the street of the exit I was already at!  I looked at the map and it appeared to me that all I needed to do was turn left on the exit street I was already at, continue straight over the highway... and I was there!  Once I did this, I was like, \"wtf is nav doing to me!?!?\"\n* Nav always leans towards highways, no matter how packed.  I've had nav tell me to get on a highway, and then once on, and stuck in an awful traffic jam, it told me to exit!  From my start point, I was headed northeast.  Nav was going to have me go a bit south, then east too far, then northwest to reach my destination via highway.  If it were late at night and highways were clear, it's a good idea.  Nav told me to do it during the day and once on the highway, it was a disaster and I had to exit.  I lost all the gains I would have had if I had simply taken streets to begin with.\n\nPun intended...   who the hell is at the wheel with these algorithms?  I'm beginning to think that the absolute dumbest people on earth are the ones programming navigation apps.  They should all be fired immediately, (and I'm pro-labor).

There are a variety of reasons, which include manufacturer liability, ambient temperature, tire size, tire wear, and tire inflation.  \n\n\nGPS is usually very accurate, with a few caveats.     \n\n\nThere is a little lag in GPS speed updates.  So, if you do a hard acceleration or braking, it'll be a little behind.     \n\n\nIf you're changing altitude (uphill or downhill), it can be off.  That's usually a little slower than your actual ground speed.  \n\n\nWeather and other interference can have a significant impact on both GPS speed and location.   So clouds, fog, rain, or driving through an area with tall buildings will impact it.  \n\n\nIf you want to see your totally accurate speed, pick a long flat straight road, and hold your speed as accurately as possible.  \n\n\nCar manufacturers don't want to be responsible for a ticket.  Like, if your speedometer shows 65mph, but you're really doing 75mph, you could sue them.    \n\n\nCars use the number of times the driveshaft or tires turn per minute to determine the ground speed.  The sensor can be in the transmission near the tailshaft, or at the wheel hubs.  \n\n\nDifferent tires can have different heights, even if they're an identical size.  It's just the way it works.   Different tire and rim options, even if they're OEM, don't necessarily get the speedometer recalibrated.    \n\n\nTire inflation can raise or lower the total height, meaning a slightly different number of rotations per mile.  Likewise, tire wear has the same effect.  \n\n\nAll those onboard car factors are a ratio.  So it'll be a bigger difference at 65mph, than it is at 5 mph.  \n\n\nCruise control in your car isn't always a fixed speed either.  I've seen it fluctuate up to about 3mph when the load changes.  Like, going up or down a little hill, or even wind blowing.  \n\n\nUse the GPS, and mentally calibrate your speedometer.   Know that 65mph really means 62, and drive accordingly.   \n\n\nIf you have multiple cars in your household, you'll probably notice they're all off by different amounts.     \n\n\nMy GF's car shows 72 mph slow at 65mph.     \nMy SUV shows about 70mph  at 65mph.  \nMy car shows 68mph at 65mph.  \n\n\nIf there's a cop behind me, I'll put the speedometer indicated speed right under the speed limit, knowing it really means I'm going a bit slower."}, {"id": "escatg7", "body": "Geez, how many do you have?"}, {"id": "escba71", "body": "7"}, {"id": "eser7d1", "body": "... cruise control?"}, {"id": "eser9s2", "body": "https://www.thrillist.com/cars/your-speedometer-is-wrong-speed-calibration-inaccuracy-in-german-american-and-japanese-cars"}, {"id": "c5hndt", "body": "For the past week and change I haven't had police notifications announced or on my screen in NY (not  NYC) and just found out a relative has the same issue.

Give the darned thing another couple seconds to try.\n\nIt seems really silly I have to go 100 miles then route the rest of the trip.

The only one to correct it is to close out the app, reopen it, and then my current location will be on the actual street that I'm on. Quite a bit of an inconvenience. Not entirely certain how to report bugs like this, but if theres something I'm missing, please inform me on how to update my location without closing out the app\n\nand I wouldn't mind reporting it as a bug, but it's not just a beta issue, its an app issue that has been the same for the past few updates, beta or not\n\nUsually only happens when the direction calls for me to get on the highway and I miss the entrance. I can't recall it happening any other times, it'll usually update that I'm going the wrong way or turned down the wrong street etc. I understand that i am driving somewhat parallel to the freeway, but Im literally at least 4 lanes in width from the highway, so it should definitely pick up that I didn't get on and update the route imo. not to mention even when the freeway curves a certain direction and the street continues straight it still often times will have me following that curve on the expressway."}, {"id": "exfbznz", "body": "Try toggling on your actual GPS position with this code.

Today I was using Castbox for I have played around with switching to it so I could listen to my podcasts w Waze. The app itself is pretty good. I can't complain, but I noticed something: Waze built in controls  1) force you to open the app anyway and select there (rather than simply retrieving some specified playlist), 2) are so limited to be useless.  I just ended up going to Castbox.  In fact, the fwd and back buttons did skip ahead/back x secs but took me to a new podcast. Lol.  To be honest, this is one place where AA did a pretty good job and finding that balance between useful integration and not too distracting.\n\nSo, in the end, I'll just deal w fiddling around more.

Earlier versions of Waze verified you were a passenger or that the vehicle was stopped before allowing you to manipulate the app.  They even displayed advertising only when stopped (and cleared those automatically once moving again).\r\n\r\nWhile the main responsibility is driving, the second responsibility is navigation.  As I indicated in my (apparently unread) post, my alternative when Waze overlays their directions with a full page ad that needs multiple actions to remove, is to choose a route and then check for navigation information when I can safely dispose of their advertisement.\r\n\r\nMy question was not intended to indicate that I cannot drive if an advertisement is displayed on my GPS overlaying the navigation information.  The main times I have found this problematic is at roundabouts or when I exit as planned and then am immediately presented with three possible poorly marked turnoffs.  \r\n\r\nI have used Garmin GPSes for over 20 years and have always double-checked my memory with a quick glance at the screen as I enter these situations.  If WAZE does not want to provide the information, I will go with my instincts and take corrective action later.  \r\n\r\nTo attack someone as an incompetent driver for questioning the decision to present full screen ads when the rest of the app was designed not to interfere with navigation information and whether or not some lawyer might decide to take them to court demonstrates that this person has lived in a far kinder world than I do.  If lawyers will sue when an idiot dumps coffee on her lap, they will sue when an idiot plays with their phone rather than driving.  The fact that Waze was otherwise designed not to interfere with their navigation information nor to require a driver to manipulate the app while driving shows that some part of their organization recognizes this risk.  Hence I asked what their liability might be.\r\n\r\nI think if I were a lawyer, and I had a driver crash into my client in such a situation, I would likely sue both knowing that the amount I can collect from the driver may be limited by the amount of insurance coverage he has."}, {"id": "eyeoiu1", "body": "That was a lot of words. \n\nHas Waze changed to full page ads while moving or that don't auto dismiss when you start moving?

Even if every single app did stop routing users along those roads, so long as they remain designated as public roads open to any driver who happens upon them, then sooner or later someone will happen upon them, and if they still end up having an accident as a result, who would the author suggest should be to blame then?\n\n\nI dunno, it feels like an article written with good intentions - the whole argument over how traffic-aware apps like Waze can cause significant changes in local traffic patterns is a perfectly valid one, and it is something I know Waze are discussing with my local traffic authority at least, so I'm guessing they're having similar discussions  elsewhere in the world too.

This was my post about it, and even though I had advanced to rank 2 I still didn't feel comfortable editing a major intersection without someone checking it.\n\nSo the lock levels are set based on a road's importance to routing where the higher the classification, the more experience you need to edit it.    Breaking an Interstate could be a real problem to through routing. I'm a rank 5 and even with five years experience, I'll still often ask another editor to overlook work I do if it's a complicated edit.  \n\nSorry you had some bad experiences.

I\u2019m a heavy user and contribute about 2,000 miles of data per month. I\u2019d enjoy seeing them go above and beyond... here are some random ideas:\n\n1. Sometimes there\u2019s a high variability in speed by lanes. I know they can\u2019t detect to the precision of a lane easily, but there could be heavy traffic for certain exits (game days, etc.) and you sometimes need to know to steer away from getting caught in that.\n\n2. Why haven\u2019t they integrated data with radar detectors yet? Both could become more intelligent with the others data.\n\n3. Accelerometer information - if enough peoples phones record a \u201cbump\u201d in a certain spot on the road, couldn\u2019t that mark it as a pothole?\n\nThey have a large advantage over other apps for the more savvy users, and it probably augments Google Maps data a lot and allows them to get free reporting with some amount of verification to improve the experience for the masses on their Maps product. But I hope it doesn\u2019t turn into another Google product like Nest... where they appear to kind of rest on their gains. I was a very early adopter of Nest and am likely to switch away because it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Just haven\u2019t gotten around to evaluating alternatives.\n\nSorry for my rant. I still use Waze every day and recommend it to every one. But I hope we see some advancement.\n\nAnd the whole carpooling thing? Sigh... hope it works for some. But I drive in the first place for flexibility over the bus system. If they allowed me to offer rides kind of on a \u201cwhim\u201d whenever I\u2019m headed somewhere, I would consider it more.

I believe it affected a data channel Waze uses to sync itself. I believe googlemaps uses a different path as it's unaffected. It could be a permission issue, it could be a design issue, either way I do not believe waze is at fault other than being lazy and slow to update.\n\nLaunching Google Maps seems to give Waze a way to stay connected if you're getting some connectivity with Waze already.
