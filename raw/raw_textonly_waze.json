        "body": "Seriously Waze whomever is in charge of UX needs to be fired.  It's that bad.  If you've changed UX lead in the past few years then whomever is in charge of hiring them should also be fired.  Please consider hiring a UX consulting team with a solid reputation to come fix your UX and then have them help you hire a competent person on your behalf.  Credit where credit is due.  You fixed this a while ago, but I don't want you to think it went unnoticed.  Thank you for getting rid of the invisible button to control the sound.  Not having invisible buttons should be a no brainer.  Thankfully that was just a nitpick not the end of the world.  It didn't make the app  unsafe. Sadly, the UI you currently have is both less usable and unsafe.The floating instruction bar in horizontal mode.One of the most important rules of UX design is that you do not move elements on your UI based on user input.  I.e. it is in bad form to have a button that moves when the user moves his/her mouse.   A real world example of this would be in OSX when you move your mouse towards the toolbar and the icon magnifies.  It's a nitpick in this example but it's not the end of the world.Unfortunately for your app this is more of a safety concern.  You have this floating instruction bar and the map is moving based on the vehicle's GPS data.  For all intents and purposes you're moving the floating instruction bar all over the map.  So when I come to a stop light and need to turn left do I need to turn left immediately or in 30 feet? I can't tell because you're covering that aspect of the screen.  GPS isn't always perfectly accurate so it helps to know if I need to take the first turn or the 2nd turn.Lock the tool bar to the top as it was before and we don't need to deal with this frustration again.  Finally, not having the car centered is simply in poor taste.  AdsThey pop up right on the information that I am using when I am driving.  Maybe consider having these pop up when I'm not going to have to turn in 50 feet?  That would be wonderful.  Better still maybe have them slide on the bottom and replace the bottom toolbar for a few seconds.  This way it's not ever going to be over crucial information that people are glancing at when they are performing a more risky maneuver IE turning is complicated and prone to accidents then simply driving straight.  While I haven't had any accidents while using this because obviously I prioritize avoiding accidents over following directions.  It's frustrating when I'm in an unfamiliar area and end up taking a wrong turn, because when I glanced at the screen to briefly get the important information I needed it was not visible to me.  Personally I've found myself using your app less and less because it is less usable.  "

Those choices are available once navigation begins, anyway.This is also annoying because if I do want to see routes, I shouldn't be on a countdown timer to choose quick or else Waze starts the trip.In the search-initiated context, it would make more sense if the choices to see routes or share were on the destination page, and Go immediately started navigation using the default routing."

I say this because this was sort of my fault for taking a couple wrong turns and not trusting my gut when I should have. I was on my way back from a restaurant that's 30 minutes away from my house by using a toll road. My cell phone reception sucked going out of the parking garage, and it took a while to readjust, however when it did, I managed to find myself on the toll road that was needed.Everything was going fine, but Waze hadn't readjusted to tell me to continue down this toll road. Instead, Waze wanted me to switch into the airport traffic lanes for my nearby airport. This is also where I messed up by not trusting my gut, because I thought Waze probably knew something that I didn't. So I switch into those lanes. Waze wanted me to get back onto the toll road that ran parallel to this lane that I was in, however this way was closed. So, Waze took me all the way to the airport and around the rented car lots and all that. At this point, I'm sort of stressed out because I realized that I had essentially piggybacked off the toll road for free without going through a toll plaza, which is of course illegal. So, I ended up home safe and sound. Waze technically did its job. However, I don't use Waze that often at all since I'm young and I usually only drive short distances around my town. Because of that, I did not know I could file a map issue report. I'm lucky I was not caught, but I'm surprised Waze took me on a route to freeload the toll road. I do realize there's a lot of people who finesse the toll road in the exact same way though. I wish I had known better to report the map issue and to follow my gut and stay on the familiar road.TL;DR Because I was dumb, and took a wrong turn, Waze had me loop around my nearby airport, basically having me piggyback the toll road for free, which is illegal."

I think it's poorly scripted at the moment. And battery-wise, instead of draining the battery on highway, it stayed at the same charge level (which is already an improvement for me).

Those yellow/orange/red/maroon stripes that get laid down when Waze wants to mark traffic on your route.It seems like Waze assumes that traffic always starts/ends at some sort of intersection.  That's a reasonable assumption, most of the time -- heavy traffic leaves the road, or comes onto the road, or whatever.  But it seems like it's *only* and *always* at those intersections.  And when I report a legitimate 'standstill' that's caused by some rubbernecking or an accident or whatever, this 2.5 mile stretch of road gets marked with a 9 MPH dark red stripe when in reality the jam lasts like .4 miles or something.It'd be great if Waze either automatically segmented longer stretches for this purpose, or even better, realized that an accident might need to create an additional segment (or both, honestly)."

They can theoretically be made anywhere using the Waze Editor and if you are a high enough rank.That being said, traffic is calculated by how long traffic traverses those segments. There's allowances of course for red lights but it's the average speed based on the time of day.  To your point about the jam lasting past the segment is valid. Unless the jam contributes to an overall longer exit time in that segment, you won't see it reflected on the map -- just the before part.Your first suggestion isn't all that bad really. If a slowdown is detected then add the travel time between those two segments. The one problem I see is that it would drastically increase the compute time on the servers. Think of an intersection with three possible exit points. If the accident was straight then the times between the right and left turns would be increased (but not by much) whereas the straight exit would be impacted a lot. Waze would know what estimate to give you if you programmed your route but theoretically would increase the compute by a factor of three per incident. If you didn't route through Waze, then it wouldn't know how to inform you of the delay."

Often times I'll pull into a parking-lot where the stop's entry is, and Waze thinks I'm still on the road so it doesn't clear the stop.* Being able to add more than one stop.* Being able to mark stop-signs in-editor. Waze is oblivious to whether or not there's stop-signs on a road, so it's perfectly happy suggesting you take a shortcut, even though you'd be stuck behind 3 stop-signs along the way.* Adding Android Auto support for phone-only setups. Although I have a newer car with a touch screen, it happens to be a Toyota (who has sworn off Android Auto in favor of their crappy in-house alternative). I'd love to be able to access Waze from the phone app by itself.What do you guys want to see?"

Often times I'll pull into a parking-lot where the stop's entry is, and Waze thinks I'm still on the road so it doesn't clear the stop.I've had the opposite happen and would prefer smaller distances.  Somebody will be unhappy with any preset value, and Waze has historically not been very interested in having such tweakable things available to users.>Being able to mark stop-signs in-editor. Waze is oblivious to whether or not there's stop-signs on a road, so it's perfectly happy suggesting you take a shortcut, even though you'd be stuck behind 3 stop-signs along the way.This isn't needed at all.Waze already knows how fast traffic actually flows on a given segment of road for all times of day in half-hour increments for each direction, *including* stop signs and speed bumps and chicanes and even some regular occurrences like twice-daily elementary school traffic snarls.  You can taste this data by playing with the livemap.Also the speed limit in the corner of the client is for you, not for routing. It is a relatively recent addition. Waze doesn't care what the speed limit is - it just cares how fast traffic actually moves.>Being able to add more than one stop.I like this.

This person didn't know that they were set based on state functional classification and we're considered arterials dispite not being highways. The results of this was that any long distance routes would never consider going through this town. My state is good about doing unlocks and checking your work, but I have heard some states are a little more difficult. I can say the more involved you are with the local editing community, the easier that will be.Regarding the power trips, yeah unfortunately they do exist.

The only way to get to Summer st on foot is to walk to the far side by the fort point channel or be a local and know about a specific public access stairwell under one of the bridges.- Being dropped off in this unlit alleyway is sketchy and dangerous at certain times of day- It adds a huge amount of time for me personally to walk such a huge extra distance just to get into my building.- Anyone being dropped off here not familiar with the area is basically stranded since they wont know about the stairwell or how to get around.[This is a google street view link of what summer street looks like from congress street](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3495983,-71.0472944,3a,54.2y,221.29h,90.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sB-vQGl7q_tQQulH5XlQmwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). (RES users need to click it or they wont get a street view version) It is clearly visibly not accessible from congress street.My workaround for this has become to assume drivers will be using waze and put in an address of the convenience store on the corner of summer and melcher to trick the app into navigating me correctly.  But today I used the lyft line option and the poor girl who I rode in with also had an address on summer st. and the driver tried to drop her in that same alleyway and she had no idea what was going on.All I want is for waze to send people to the actual address of the building entered and not a 'close enough' point that leaves us stranded having to walk.

I checked Summer St in Boston ([here](https://www.waze.com/de/editor?env=usa&amp;lon=-71.04886&amp;lat=42.34954&amp;s=70491415&amp;zoom=6&amp;segments=85290314)) and it seems the house numbers there are indeed badly positioned so that they are closer to the alleys than the actual street. It also maybe because the street is recorded as a bridge and Waze may be reluctant to navigate onto a bridge.If you made an Waze account and use Waze in that area, then you'll be able to change it yourself. Or (also with an Waze account) post in the offical [Massachusetts forum](https://www.waze.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=618) and ask if someone could do that for you. A local area manager could also help to tell you if it's a good idea to remove the bridge status from the street.Finally a small rant: Isn't it possible to tell the driver about the problem so they don't blindly go by the navigation software? I don't have Uber where I live, but my experience with taxi drivers is that they listen to the wishes of the guest, or are flexible with the price, if they did drive you to the wrong place. I can imagine Uber doesn't allow 'discounts' if such a problem arises. Personally I'd give the driver a low rating or even avoid Uber if they have such problems, that can't be solved by talking to the driver."

But the problem I'm having is the lack of maintainers in my area. Or anyone using the app.I even tried going to the editor to change things myself, but how am I supposed to edit roads that are locked to Level 3 at level 1? I spent hours trying to add places and roads only to get edit errors, because I can't connect a higher level road to my level 1 road. No one is accepting the newly added things that were added 3 or 4 days ago and I even see some changes that weren't accepted/rejected since last year.That's not even the main issue, but the main roads miss speed limits or have them set wrong (50 in 90 areas) and there are speed traps set up that aren't there for years anymore.So in short, what's the point of using this app since there aren't any people reporting police and other things on the road, the speed limits are wrong and in the end Google Maps has all the places already set up so there is no need to set them up again. What could I do to fix these changes?* I'm posting here because forums give 502 Bad Gateway.. I'm losing hope in this app rather quickly."

Recently[ saw this article](http://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/google-maps-best-navigation-app) where apparently Apple Maps is more accurate and Google Maps gets you to your destination faster. I've used Waze for years, according to Waze's website I've driven 126,909 miles with Waze. I used to be involved with updating the map but once area managers started locking everything a few years ago I just quit because it's such a PITA now to get anything done. The map used to be the greatest part of Waze because it was updated so quickly. These days if I find an issue on the map, when I report it I end up trying to convince some AM that yes the city really did put a median there so now you can't turn left. I once got a response with 'well that's not showing on Google street view' and it just blew my mind because I remember a time when using any other source was a huge no-no. Or I've found where the AM marks a turn as not allowed when it is and when I try to correct it I'm told that the map is more efficient to have that turn be not allowed. My theory had always been mark the roads as they are and let the algorithm figure it out. The AMs near me have a different idea and IMO they seem to be ruining the app. I also find them to be toxic to the community.Maybe you can reach out to your AM directly, maybe you'll have more luck than I. But in the end it seems to me that they're mostly made up of people who view the map as their baby, they put a lot of time and effort into it, and they don't tolerate someone telling them they made a mistake."

Despite the locked maps, reporting map problems does seem to work. All the issues I have reported have been addressed. So, while Google maps may be more accurate and also display lane details, I still like Waze for the social reporting aspect. Sometimes it does help get me places, while avoiding trouble spots.

Thanks goes out to every one who maintains the maps and drops pins letting others know. I'll always give a thumbs up.Beep beep!"

Waze not only helps by drawing a fastest route, but allows us to communicate through reporting things that happen on the road, enchancing safety for everyone. I am active user, and in my area i often find myself in the situation where i am driving and reportin accident simultaneosly. And driving of course is a priority. So i would like to see feature that allows me set point of incident 100 meters behind me. It would really help, because i do feel bad for making it too slow and then i see report pop up in wrong place and feel even worse. I even thing that it should be cruicial for app to making such a reporting (of accidents) in my area as easy as 1-click...hehe, guess where i am from."

My oneplus one stays without any chip, just has waze and spotify installed, all my playlist is downloaded and I keep the spotify offline.This uses around 150 mb/month (or 5mb/day).

Second, and possibly more important, is that when I put in an intermediary point as a destination, it could defeat the smart routing feature of Waze. One of the milestones on our trip down I95 is the Lombardi Rest Area which is right on the NJ side of the George Washington Bridge in to NYC.

Since it doesn't know I'm going to New Hampshire, it doesn't redirect me. This could be only a problem for me. Maybe I'm asking Waze to do something it's not meant to do. "

Finally I gave up. Used Waze for the past few years with no problems, but now Waze is doing the same thing. I followed all of the above steps, with no luck. My phone is sitting in a dash mount, and the map will just flip upside down, and my car icon appears as through I'm driving in reverse down whatever road I'm on. Waze constantly tries to reroute me; basically, at that point, the app is unusable. Here are other guesses I've made based on other threads here and elsewhere: perhaps it's my abysmal data connection that I often get with Sprint; the app can't keep up with where I actually am, and this problem just cant be fixed. Or, the slight vibrations from my phone being mounting are screwing with the compass and/or the gyrometer. Or, perhaps neither of these apps like the phone being mounted vertically --  the problem seems to sometimes resolve itself if I take the phone out of the dash mount and hold it for a few minutes.

The problem is, more often than not, Waze can't find GPS.  I'd say 95% of the time.  iPhone 6S Plus, has run Waze just fine since I got the phone, I've signed out and in to my Waze account.  I've made sure Location Services are on, Always, for Waze.  I have toggled it off and on.  I have done (several) hard resets of the phone.  I am on iOS 11.3.1, and have not updated during the time that Waze stopped finding GPS.  I am not in any locations that are different.  New Vehicle is a Rogue, with Apple CarPlay.  And its own navigation.  And a Garmin Speak.  All those things find GPS just fine.  Apple Maps and Google Maps work.  It's just Waze that does not.  Additionally, Waze does not work away from the vehicle- so I don't think it can be some other GPS product interfering with Waze.  I mean, walking out to my car, from work, Waze already can't find GPS.  One thing I haven't tried is deleting the app and reinstalling it.  Is it me- or is anyone else experiencing this?  "

This stereo, unlike previous 2015 same vehicle without nav system, plays very crappily via Bluetooth, so I can't just not connect the phone by USB.  I'm not really happy not using Waze.  For trips, I guess I could run Waze on another device.  I have one more thing to try- disabling CarPlay in the phone menu, but that might (probably will) shut down my music entirely.

So you'll only be warned when approaching a live camera.A word of warning, however: this doesn't apply for average speed cameras, of which you only need two at any distance to be able to be prosecuted. On the A12 there are a couple of stretches that have average speed zones - Waze alerts you to those as well as the actual cameras.Also, be aware that Waze is only as accurate as the community of volunteer editors and the people that contribute. You can create a map issue if you think they've missed a actual speed camera, and help other drivers on the road, too.The easy solution is just don't speed. Once you factor in the 10% the cops will give you before prosecuting, and/or the slight difference between what your needle says and what you're actually doing (needle will always be approx 5% lower), that should typically be more than enough to keep your journey efficient."

It just resulted in new users confirming bad gas prices.  It was so rare to see a correct gas price that I never bothered using Waze to check gas prices, and I'm pretty sure nobody else did either."

Question: if I select the option to have the app listen for 'Ok Waze' it will prevent audio from another app playing in the background. I can't have music from the Music app or podcasts from Overcast etc. playing in the background as they cut off immediately when I open Waze. If I turn off 'Ok Waze' (but still have the 3 finger tap option on) it works fine and leaves audio playing in the background. I assume this is a limitation on iOS or am I doing something wrong? Also is 3 finger tap my only other option for voice control or is the 'cover the screen with your hand' an option on iOS somehow?PS: the app is sometimes very fast and sometimes lags. Waze remains 'imperfect' but darn there is nothing as good as showing you where to go and letting you know about genuinely important hazards ahead. The fact you can feel good about contributing back information to the community on the drive is icing on the cake. "

Usually if you start driving a bit and keep your phone in the windshield area with view of the sky so it can get a GPS lock, it will pick it up and zero in where you really are.Also you can check to see if your GPS bit in your phone is going bad.  Run another maps app and see where it has you located.  Preferably a GPS type of an app, like a hiking app.  Why? Because all road apps approximate your location then snap you to the closest road unless you are far away from a road. (This isn't required of course, but just useful as a debugging tool)"

In the other case it sends me in the opposite direction I'd normally go to do a route that is 15 mins longer than the one I've driven for a decade.

They aren't highways, but they are well traveled. There is never traffic on these roads so the time is always the same. Honestly, I take this way 80% of the time unless there's a holiday and highway traffic would be lower. The problem is, Waze only shows me this way like... 20% of the time. Even if I start driving that way, it refuses to reroute me and instead tries to get me to make these insane u-turns, all of which would take me double the time to get to work.I'm not a frequenter of this sub but I've used Waze since ~2013 and things like this were never a problem. I see a lot of you agree with me on this. In fact, Waze has showed me ways I would have never thought to go myself, even having lived in the area for 26 years!My theory is that residents are complaining that Waze was rerouting traffic through their once-quiet neighborhoods, so Waze resorted to just trying to set everyone to stay on the highway.

The arrival time estimation is noticeably worse than it used to be, always on the low side.   i.e. I leave at 6:30 and the arrival time says 7:30.  OK, great.  But then the arrival time just creeps up and up as I drive, not with particularly bad traffic either, usually ~15 minutes late (~7:45).  I've simply started mentally adding 15 minutes to the arrival time of any drive over an hour.2. The 'We've found a better route' feature seems to have gone away - I haven't seen it in several weeks and now I can't find it in settings.  So I find myself frequently going into the Routes list while I drive.  Sometimes a much better route is at the top of the list.  Sometimes the route I am currently on is on the list, and sometimes it isn't.   Can I re-enable this somehow, or is it gone?3. I concur with [this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/waze/comments/8rd7nl/waze_directions_starting_to_become_terrible/) - happens to me once in a while as well.4. Maybe this is a consequence of less people using the app, or the novelty wearing off, but I find that a lot of hazards (apart from speed traps, lol) just aren't marked.  Notice that I'm marking hazards on the map (construction or cars stopped on the road) much more often than I used to.  I.e. 2-3 on my morning commute, when it used to be zero."

Waze typically chooses the street where the highway starts/ends as the entry point.  95% of the time this is a complete shit show.  It sometimes tries to route me on nearby side streets but it is not helpful and counter productive. It thinks I can just whip around and get back on the main street, but traffic is so bad that sometimes it can take 15+ minutes to go half of block (~10 car lengths) because it's so busy.  It feels like you're just sitting it one spot indefinitely, and it underestimates the time of getting through that traffic by 20+ minutes on what is said to be a 45 minute drive. Once in a while, when it hits the threshold, it routes me to get on one exit north.  This is significantly better as the traffic there is heavy but you're not sitting in one spot indefinitely. The time estimate is then fairly accurate.I want to go this way regularly but it never shows it as an option.  It only offers up the primary route and 2 other completely different ones which I would never take. Is there a way to force it to take me via the second exit? I tried to trick it by doing a 'stop' at 2ndExit &amp; Hwy but it still chooses the original route and just tells me to get off shortly after entering as it intended.  I could try just driving past the main road but there are so many different possible routes and it usually zig-zags me across so I would prefer if it just navigated me that way from the start, if possible.Thank you"

If you've been doing it your way for a while and it's not working, it may be that your command 'Navigate Home' is mucking up the auto-learning somehow. It's trying, but since it's not completing the action, it doesn't memorize. Try instead using 'OK Google - Open Waze' and then manually navigate there a few times. See if that improves your results."

Waze and Google Maps have each shown me dozens of different ways to get from here to there and back, and both work really well (I started using Google maps recently and started wondering why Google hasn't combined the two or vastly upgraded Waze, which seems to lag behind in features).Unfortunately, I've lost a degree of confidence in both apps.There are times when I miss a turn, or purposefully deviated from the route to a route that an app has told me to go in the past, and it forces a recalculation. That calculation usually increases the time estimate, but in a surprising number of cases (several times a week) the recalculations saves me a few minutes or as many as 10.Yesterday, for example, I was close to home and GM estimated 25 minutes to home down a fairly congested two-lane highway. I took a turn onto a side road that both Waze and GM have recommended in the past, and immediately my estimate was reduced by 11 minutes. Almost 50%.So why isn't it sending me that way in the first place? Is it a compute issue? Like they can't constantly be recalculating routes for tens of thousands of commuters? Is it a manipulation issue? Like so many people use these apps that they force some onto a slower route to avoid congestion on other routes?During any given commute, the route will recalculate and give me a faster route (it's rare, but happens more often with Waze). So why doesn't it do this more often, considering that traffic changes constantly?It's supremely frustrating, and I'm just curious if I'm the only one that notices this."

I could be totally wrong about this but I thought it was worth posting in case somebody knows more.  OTOH i've heard it will sometimes route you on a path it wants, but does not have, data on.  If its collecting data on who blindly follows Waze  and using that data to decide whom to send on those data-getting routes, I'm almost surely that person. I have seen this shorter time after recalculating and it makes me loose faith in the fastest route.  I've seen it repeatedly on one specific route option where Waze always tells me to take a certain hwy and I instead take a certain parkway, and it almost always shortens my ETA immediately. "

Manually tapping 'routes' seems to force a recalc and sometimes presents me with shorter routes that I wish it would update to automatically.

So only one line is needed into the gas station here so anyone in the gas station will lock in on that line and be instructed to turn left or right when exiting the station, even if there are actually two exits in real life from the station. The instruction will still work.   Keeping the map as simple as possible also helps the routing engine not waste time going over an almost infinite number of route possibilities.

In both cases, I exited the road into a parking lot that was not mapped on the system I was testing, and made sure, while in the parking lot, to drive in the opposite direction from where I was going to navigate. (This is the part that screws up Waze.)[As you can see](https://imgur.com/a/qVcB5ZL), when I was in a parking lot with the Nuvi, it showed my location off the road. I had driven westward from one end of the parking lot to the other. When I told it to navigate to a point east of my location, it simply started my route at a point on the road closest to my current location and said, 'Please proceed to highlighted route.' In this case, Waze would have assumed I was headed westward on the road, and would have calculated an unnecessarily circuitous route.With Google maps, I tested a corner parking lot that is not mapped, using the same parameters. I got two different routes, depending on where I was in the parking lot. Each started on the closest point on the road to my current location, and routed in the proper direction. In the first of the two images, the navigation started on a road that doesn't actually connect to the parking lot, but that's okay, because I can see the route, I can see where I am in relation to the route, and I can get myself onto one of the connecting roads headed in the right direction. Waze, on the other hand, would have put my on the road headed northwest and then routed me around to get back to where I should be."

That's what your demonstrations show here.

If it wants to change its mind on what is the best route while I'm halfway there, I'd prefer if it just reroutes me and gives me the next direction. That distracts me less as a driver. I know it will get me there, so I would rather I just trust it than it bothers me.When consumer car GPS first became a thing, when you went off its route it used to say 'recalculating. ... recalculating... recalculating...' and beep, then it might bring up the new route, or (depending on what brand and model) it might put a button up for you to press to confirm it. This used to make drivers *nuts*, because you'd miss one turn and it'd start saying 'recalculating' over and over again. People would scream at their GPS. Finally the GPS companies learned that they shouldn't make it say anything, they should just make it recalculate silently and give you the next direction. Suddenly drivers were much happier.If I miss a turn and don't know it, the GPS won't give me a long winded explanation of this fact, it will just do its thing to get me on track, and I won't necessarily know anything happened. Similarly, if it thinks it has a better route for me, I want it to just do its thing to get me on the optimal track, and I don't want any long winded explanation that anything happened. "

But even with the setting adjusted it still seems to stick me to major roads and mostly avoid hard-lefts, it's almost the same as Google Maps as far as route reliability.    2 major points for me to keep using Waze  * I can edit the map and make sure its up-to-date with the latest highway changes and new neighborhoods (Delivery/Uber driver, I end up in new neighborhoods quite a bit)  * I absolutely HATE that google maps always feels the need to display '1 minute slower', '15 minutes slower', 'Similar Eta' on every odd route I could possibly go. Just give me a route and show me just that, if I want alternates I'll ask (As I do with Waze). I have actually switched to Gmaps for 1 drive after getting annoyed with other Waze crap, then switched right back after being reminded about the damn alternate route clutter. "

I typically drive from Irvine, CA to Simi Valley, CA every Thursday afternoon which takes ~3 hours. Waze used to give me 3 route options just about every time. Lately, however, it is only giving me one option which takes a series of freeways that add an additional 30 miles to drive. I've tried taking this long route many times and Waze always underestimates it due to how there are certain lanes you have to get into which are really slow while the rest of the freeway is moving fast. So I usually just have to pick my own route and eventually Waze will catch on and let me know how long it will take. Any ideas on why it is no longer offering multiple route options? I've also noticed that lately many of the routes it suggests are just bad and I will ignore them and then once it recalculates to the way I decided to go then the time goes down.

If I see traffic on 1, even if that's a little quicker, I'd much rather add 5 minutes and avoid the traffic.  But NOOOOO.... Waze seems to NEVER give those as routing options.  It isn't until I start down those roads that it's like 'Oh, OK... here's this new route that will add 2 minutes and completely avoids the traffic'.  Gee, thanks.  Why it didn't give me that option in the first place is beyond me.I've been using Waze for years.  It didn't used to be like this.  They must have changed the routing algorithms.  I don't know.  I have to constantly re-check the route options to get it to efficiently route me.  Annoying.  It really shouldn't be this hard.

However, depending on how the intersection has been mapped out, this learning process may not work as well as it ought to, in which case the map data can be modified to help Waze learn better.So the short answer is that, yes, there possibly is something that can be done to improve routing at this location, and the best way forward would be to bring this intersection to the notice of the local editors, either by submitting a map issue report at the location, or by posting about it in the relevant local area forum on the Waze website."

Unless you're already familiar with the editing side of Waze, then you're best off just reporting this area for others to do the detailed investigation work...I'm guessing from your use of language that you're somewhere in North America, which isn't a part of the world I'm particularly familiar with as far as the Waze editing community goes - I'm the other side of the pond in the UK, and here it'd be unusual for reports of problems in major areas to go untouched for extended periods of time.  I do know that the NA community is pretty active across the continent, but due to the sheer size of the area covered, they do struggle to keep on top of reports.  But even so, I'd still not expect them to go untouched for the sort of timescales you're describing here.Have you had *any* sort of feedback to any of your reports?  One thing to bear in mind (which IIRC isn't made clear in the wording Waze use) is that the email which gets sent to the reporting user whenever an editor responds to the report, is only to let you know about the reply.  If you then try responding to the email itself, as would seem to be the obvious thing to do, rather than via the inbox within the Waze app, your email gets silently ditched by the Waze mail server without ever being seen by the editor who responded.  So if you do get a response which is asking for further details to help the editor understand the problem, it's vital to reply via the app in order for your reply to get back to the editor.But tbh, if it's a problem that has the potential to require some back and forth discussion, provision of photos or other supporting evidence etc, then going via the forums is so much easier, and if your local editing community is as active in the forums as we are over here, it gives your problem a very good chance of being seen by someone who understands what the problem is and has the necessary editing rights to do something about  it."

Waze records transitional times on segments at the junction node of each road.  This is usually really accurate but can be messed up when there are junction nodes before an intersection that backs up regularly before those intermediary nodes.  For example a node not far before an intersection for a side road to go into a gas station or other parking lot can pollute the data if there's a lot of right turns that don't wait for the light much.  It averages out the movement across that node to turn into the parking lot between left, right, and straight turns a little bit further up and hence under-represents the time taken to make the left turn or go straight.This is really common in areas that have long stacks of cars waiting to get through a light.  A higher ranking editor can fix this if they know about it. If you want to PM me where this is I can have a look for you.  ps, as far as not getting responses on map reports, that really depends on the area.  For example, New York City generates hundreds of reports a day and it's hard for volunteers to keep up with them.   Usually people who work on them also live in that area. Not every waze editor can work on every area's reports. "

In simpler cases it's a matter of just redesigning the intersection a little bit.   I've created a few in my state where they are warranted.  For example, a typical box intersection where two divided highways meet, let's say you are coming from the south and heading west. The left and straight movements both go straight over the first junction at the lower right in the square, then the left goes left at the top right of the box. So the nearest junction node at the bottom right where people wait for the light only sees traffic going right and straight.   Real left and straight traffic there gets counted together in that node.  If the left turns have a longer red light or get backed up where you have to wait more than one light cycle, that gets averaged in to that node with straight traffic so left turns don't count as long but straight movements are assumed longer than they are. But that can be fixed without a junction box too. Are you an editor? Have you spoke about possible cases to your state managers? "

I can't recall if the display of reports is enabled by default - if you don't see any report markers (upside down raindrops in yellow, orange and red with a white Waze logo in the middle) you may need to investigate the display layers settings by using the drop down menu in the top right corner of the editor window.Once you've got markers showing up, find the right part of the map and then see what's visible there.  If it's an area with lots of reports, you may need to zoom in to reduce the number of reports the editor is handling - it has an internal limit of 500, and in some areas it's easy to exceed this if you're viewing the map at a low zoom level...The colour of the report markers indicates how old they are - anything more than 2 weeks old is red, so you'll be wanting to concentrate on those and ignore the yellow/orange ones unless you're also trying to find new reports you've made in the past few days.If you don't find any, then it either means they were closed off without your receiving the notification of this due to some server glitches or other faults, or it means they weren't received by the server in the first place.  This latter issue is more likely, as the server doesn't process reports until it's received the corresponding drive data from your app at the end of the drive - it needs this in order to provide us with extracts of your GPS and routing traces to help us try and figure out what might be going on.  Now, the problem here is that, as noted above, the drive data only gets uploaded to the server when you close the app at the end of your journey.  If you do this in an area with poor/non existent network coverage, your phone may not be able to get that data up to the server, and so your entire drive is essentially forgotten, including any reports you submitted during it...Anyway, see how you go in trying to find something in the editor, and if you need any help with this then I'd suggest approaching your local editing community via the forums for this as well - though I'm happy to try continuing to help from here too if needed.  Good luck!"

If they have Waze running it will learn from them as much as it learns from people who don't use illegal maneuvers. You may ask Seattle to do some Bus Lane emphasis at this location. They've done it before and handed out tickets to anyone they found violating the restriction. Keep in mind though that many of the bus only lanes on the surface streets only have restrictions certain times of the day. If this is the case Waze will only show separation during those times. The bus only lanes on the freeways are usually bus only 24/7. They also can do red light emphasis if you have an intersection that commonly has drivers sneaking in at the end of a red light blocking the intersection for cross traffic. I haven't seen Seattle do much of either emphasis this year, or at least they haven't announced it like they did in years past."

It also allows me to select options to avoid toll roads and look at the trade off between taking the alternative route(s) and saving time taking the toll roads. Example - I have family that Iive in different states and they all have toll roads. I don't have the EasyPass box to save on tolls and some are stupid and not worth the trade off of taking the toll roads once you see all of the routes. This also is an example of how the old way might have only selected - shortest or fastest. When I visit my sister in Chicago, I think that it's was neither the shortest nor the fastest option, but the third option - that allowed me to avoid tolls. "

If that's not an option you'd like, my other piece of advice would be try to toggle the 'play as Bluetooth phone call' option in Waze's Settings > Sound and Voice > 'Sound Output' to off.I use a BT headset usually when I drive, and sometimes my vehicle's built in BT through the audio headunit.  I found that using the 'Device Default' setting to be far more stable than 'Play as Bluetooth phone call' in both situations (BT headset and through my vehicle's headunit).

(You know the way when you're playing music on an external BT speaker that once in awhile there is a little split second of silence?  I think it's the same kind of thing.)  And the beeps are (I believe) generated by the CAR and not Waze, as an alert that there is a 'call' coming in, which really isn't a call at all. And the other suggestion (which I'd mentioned I didn't like) was to turn off the sound output entirely.  That does work, but also prevents alerts that I WANT to hear from happening (directions, obstacles, police).Your last suggestion (thank you!) might do the trick.  I hadn't seen that settings menu option and I'll give it a try.  It WAS set on 'Play as Bluetooth phone call' and that was probably the problem.

The iPhone 6 is getting up there in age, and your battery might be compromised to begin with.Second, Waze is pretty much a 'must use external power' app. The fact that your battery continues to lose charge while plugged in and charging probably indicates that you're using a low power port. Most cars only provide 0.5a on the entertainment system USB ports. It's much better to buy your own powerport-USB adapter (e.g., [this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VH84L5E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)) which can provide much higher amperage power, to keep your device powered under heavy load."

I've tried powering down and turning back on the phone, turning airplane mode on/off and resetting network settings and they were all temporary fixes if they worked at all. The solution that I've found that works best for me when I really need to rely on the GPS is that I have to turn off LTE. So I currently am using iOS 11.4.1 and go to Settings>Cellular>Cellular Data Options>Enable LTE>Off and then it will turn off the LTE radio antenna or something and go to the 4G network. Download speed sucks, but the gps doesn't get lost every 5 minutes.For what it's worth, I've considered jumping to the Android platform since the issues have become worse and worse. I went from the original Samsung Galaxy S to the iPhone 5 and then to the 6s. The appeal to me was that between the OEM and the Cell service network providers here in the USA, there was no advantage to release android OS updates or it became finger pointing by different companies as to why phone software updates would get held up for one reason or another and the end user would be left holding the bag. Pissed off, I jumped to the iPhone because they didn't have issues with getting OS updates. I also naively thought that with less handset models to adapt OS and software to since Apple controls the hardware and software, that I would have a superior experience as the end user. Well somewhere along the way, somebody has fucked up. I know it's not just me, but many iPhone users that have GPS and Cell connection problems. Between the service provider and Apple, who else is there to pass the buck/accountability on to since they control everything. How does this happen? A simple google search, YouTube search, or Reddit search amongst iPhone subreddits will reveal that many users have experienced these same problems and even developers in Apple discussion forums that are working with iOS 12 are already having problems. Again, Apple and ATT are the only people that can be blamed, right? And Apple controls the hardware and software and yet there seems to be no solution or fix in sight nor an official acknowledgement of widespread issues. It's bullshit and those two companies know it and say nothing. They are both complicit with a shitty user experience as they lean back and count their money. What good is a connected smart device - if it's not connected? If I don't see something change, I'll go to the Android handset for my next phone. They have dropped the ball here. The incentive of paying a premium for the iPhone experience has diminished significantly when the antennas, gps and software lose function or don't work together. When it comes down to accountability and who is to blame, If there is something that I am not seeing here, I'd love to know about it."

I should also mention that the cell and gps connectivity issues do not appear to be happening any more or less frequent in a certain geographic location or time of day. I don't see any relation to time of day or location as to when the problems hit. I will also had that I don't use the Bluetooth radio regularly and keep it turned off.

Currently I have very little complication on my commute in the morning and the only thing I am checking for is significant accident on my common route to work.In the evening things get more interesting.  I start by checking Google Maps.  If Google Maps indicates there is no issue on my common route I continue with Google Maps.  If Google Maps indicates any complication I switch over to Waze for a second opinion.  If Waze agrees on the complication I stick with Waze for my directions home. My reason for this is that I think Waze over thinks very small complications.  Google Maps is a little more robust for sticking to the basic route for issues that are only making a minute or two difference.  Because I like to chill out, talk on the phone or listen to radio I don't mind up to five minutes of delay on my normal simple route.

Traffic was thick but fast moving up to that point. Brake lights ahead, cars slowing quickly (as expected), when the car directly in front of me SLAMS into the car ahead of him...  There was something visually about the curve of the road, it didn't appear to me that we were approaching the slowed traffic as quickly as we were... but we did. I gave our van's ABS system a thorough live test, and moved to safety without getting ourselves involved.After the 911 call to report the accident and clearing the area (not to mention the adrenaline working it's way out of my system), upon playing it all back boy oh boy was I glad that I had that little bit of advance notice to put me on high alert.

SIGHI'm going on a road trip tomorrow and I THOUGHT I found the perfect solution.... Set up a hotspot on the iPhone and connect the Android phone to it and use Waze in the car without using cell data on that phone.  But...It seemed to work, meaning Waze displayed on the car screen with my location and map with street names. But there was no traffic data displayed!!! When I turned cell data back on on the Android phone the traffic data reappeared. Weird.  It looks like Waze must have cell data enabled on the phone in order to show more than just your location and street names. Having a wifi connection to a phone with cell data isn't enough. I guess it's kind of a strange scenario, but does anyone here have a solution?(I want to use the Android phone in the car with Waze via Android Auto, but don't have the ability to use cell data on that phone when I'm in the States.

I'm sure what happens to me or my town won't be the same for everyone, but here's what I'm noticing.Long time Wazer, back to almost when it started, but not a beta tester or anything like that.  What I've noticed, however, is that now that Waze &amp; Google Maps has gotten so popular, and everyone and I mean EVERYONE is using it now....when an incident occurs on the main route into our downtown area during rush hour, for example, Waze directs you to an alternate route.  This used to work great.  However, I've noticed with its popularity (comes great responsibility, heh) the alternate route method has become almost unusable. I say that because the moment it tells EVERYONE to use the alternative route, that alternative route instantly becomes the worst decision you could ever make.  It literally becomes a complete standstill of epic proportions. And what usually happens is, after sitting in that epic movelessness (invented a word) for 20-30 minutes, at some point it will end up saying a faster route has been found, which ends up being getting back to the original route.  So lately, I'm almost at the point to now not trust these alternative route suggestions anymore, and just stick with the original route irregardless of the fact right now it's backed up due to an accident, or whatever.  Because it will undoubtedly become the better decision, anyhow.&amp;#x200B;So why this post?  Well, for feedback and discussion, I guess.  Just an observation.  And I guess, how can Waze &amp; Google Maps, etc, combat this?  Can they create an algorithm or program their GPS to maybe proportionately allocate alternative routes to all of its users that aren't the exact same alternative route?  Or any other ideas?  Because right now as I see it, they are basically just creating new traffic jams wherever they are sending everyone, now that they are so immensely popular and everyone just depends on them to go anywhere."

The alternate roads to the main expressway getting everyone across town into the downtown area, are in no way comparable for the same amount of traffic.  They weren't designed for that purpose.  But there are *several* of them that could handle the split.  The problem is GPS sends ALL its users down that SAME one alternate route causing a massive traffic jam, worse than the original route.  It only changes the alternate route when it starts seeing all Waze users in a standstill. I know someone who reports traffic from the air for local media, who has confirmed not since more recently has he seen an alternate route pile up so quickly in a matter of minutes.  Can see from above a massive exodus down one route.Everything you said makes sense, absolutely, but the problem is it USED to work well on these SAME exact roads.

Due in part to complaints by local governments about Waze routing people through residential areas and other roads that where local planners don't expect high traffic, the Waze algorithm also applies a preference for certain types of roads.  In this case, Elm Ave is classified as a regular street.  Churchill Ln and Lower Holland Rd are both classified as Primary Streets, so Waze will prefer to use these roads over Elm, even if there is a small hit to estimated traffic time.You can read a bit more here:https://wazeopedia.waze.com/wiki/USA/National_resources/Functional_classification"

All because the state DOT basically classes every road as a major roadway (I forget the exact term the state uses) unless a local DOT fills out a bunch of paperwork to change it it stays that way.As a result local directions via Waze are next to useless, because it routes you down a 'minor highway' that's right next to another 'minor highway' because the latter has a few cars on it and the former doesn't (because the only people who go on the former are people who live in that neighborhood).I've had discussions with one of the senior map editors for my area and they really didn't care that the way they do things here makes driving directions significantly less useful, they are going under the 'technically correct is the best kind of correct' rule."

It's definitely avoiding it due to it being a street but not sure why it wants you to route right instead of left at first -- but I have a theory on that too. I see your route is at least 26 miles long, so curious how far you have gone before you get this far.  The longer the route, the more likely it is to avoid lower classed streets.  A lot of that is due to efficiency reasons.  Waze can't consider every single street when calculating a long distance route.  If there are too many major highway options for it to consider, means it's more likely to have a routing server timeout.  This is a far greater problem in the dense northeast than it is the southwest, for example -- where I regularly can get routes over 1500 miles.     Some things to check are to try to recalcuate the route when you are on Bustleton ... you may have to actually stop the route and then restart it. I'm betting it will route you down Elm at that point.My guess about your overall routing means Waze is trying to get you over to that freeway to the south of there before heading you back north."

Case in point: I take a long drive from a rural area back to my city. In the rural area there is not much traffic anyway; close to home I know the roads well and really don't need Waze's help much if at all.  BUT, right in the middle of the drive I have to pass through a couple of cities with notoriously clogged freeways. This is exactly what I want Waze to help me avoid - *the exact one thing that is most important*. And in fact I have tried to force Waze to offer alternate routes through this area, but it refused; even as I deliberately went a back route, it just kept trying to get me back to the stop-and-go mess on the freeway. I guess this is why? But if so, this seems like terrible reasoning. I mean, I understand not sending drivers through small residential streets, but there are a lot of middle-ranked roads. Waze isn't supposed to be just a GPS telling you how to get from A to B; it is supposed to help us find the best, *fastest* route. Thus the name."

The Carplay version is that terrible interface like Apple maps....you can't see the map on your Carplay dash *and* change iPhone apps (for example go to a non supported podcast player to select a podcast) at the same time.  Any app swapping on your iphone removes the Waze map on your Carplay display.Also, since the iphone now displays the turn by turn directions (who needs that on a daily commute), there is no way to add traffic reports anymore?Anyway to roll back to non-Carplay Waze?

The only character I can write is A, as soon as I try to move in the alphabet line, the 'selector' moves away from the alphabet, going over all other parts of the UI. No idea how they missed that, of if it's specific to the car (as it has no touch screen).Personally I have just turned off the screen on the phone, as I always had it on waze.

Sure, the Whitestone or Triboro bridges are shorter routes, but always very crowded, while Throggs Neck is always empty both at the bridge, and the roads leading to and from it. Yet, as I'm heading towards the bridge, the app always wants me to turn around and use one of the other routes.  Sometimes even as I'm crossing the bridge, it suggests I make a U turn somewhere after the crossing, go back over the same bridge, then head for one of the other routes across the Long Island Sound.

If there's a lot of traffic lights or train crossing that might cause a lot of variability, it may prefer a route that is slightly slower, but more consistent.  I took a look at Throgs Neck Bridge (295), I hope that's the right one.  I'm not seeing any reason why Waze would avoid that route or other users reporting problems in the area.

As I take the back way it continues to recalculate while telling me to u-turn, and the drive-time continues to tick up and up...27...28...31 minutes, until suddenly it decides, 'okay okay you win! We'll go the back way!' and recalculates the back-road route and now gives me a drive time of 19 minutes, and I've only been driving for 2.

If the city ever did get a cash infusion of $700+ million dollars to fix the roads, it would cost $200 million dollars a year to maintain those roads at the 'fair condition' level without them going back to poor condition and currently there is only 80 Million per year budgeted for maintenance so the roads, if repaired, would quickly go back to shit without the maintenance budget to maintain the fixes.

Flash forward to today, the ETA time it shows them is exactally the time they get the notification. [Here is what I'm talking about.](https://i.imgur.com/lwdBFwD.jpg) I opened this notification right after it was sent. She is at least 30 min away with good traffic. It DEFINITELY doesn't show a live map anymore with the tracking of the trip. Sometimes it just crashes when I open it. Waze has been alerting me to police or hazards literally 5-6 minutes after I passed them on the map. Sometimes it will log me out of my Waze account. No problem, I'll just sign back in. Nuh-uh! I'll reject your password and username until you reset it, even though I have all my passwords written down and organized. Only this one and Chipotle app have this problem. I mean, the navigation choices and accuracy of the map have always been a little rough, but recently it has been making huge mistakes. Sending me down one way streets it never sent me down before, horribly over or underestimating my arrival time, crashing out when any audio app is playing including Spotify. Sometimes it will crash out the audio apps and then I have to close out of Spotify/podcast app completely and restart to get audio back. These problems started happening on my 6s a year ago and they have continued to my iPhone X. I've tried reloading iOS, Waze, all my audio apps. Still the same. It's like they have really abandoned this app. It's been getting worse across multiple iOS updates so I don't think they are just waiting for iOS 12. Any long time lurkers from here having similar experiences or know fixes? Most of these posts I've searched through are just people asking about one or two issues at a time. I don't see a lot of discussion about the ongoing state of the app. "

When we get to the closed bit it acts surprised and routes me round some bullshit local lanes and takes an age to get back on the right route. Whereas the correct thing to do would have been to simply stay on the motorway and go round the entire thing and it would have been maybe 10-15 minutes longer rather than half an hour of driving through random villages. So my point is none of them are perfect. I moved to Waze after my old Tomtom started to get too out of date (even after hacking and loading the latest maps) and then there was another free nav app I used that was a lot slower and not as advanced as Waze at the time. Maybe it is time to re-evaluate, possibly look at paid solutions? When I stated using Waze Tomtom was ridiculously expensive, I'd pay a reasonable amount (around GBP 30-50) for a working solution, or maybe even a couple of quid a month for a perpetual sub? "

It worked decently out in the rural areas too in terms of routing and even saved me a couple of times on rare traffic jams out there as well. Now it's like they made it worse on purpose or something. It feels almost completely broken from where it was 2-3 years ago. I used to think if they charged an optional ad free subscription and offered rewards (like coupons, or small prizes) to subscription members for high participation scores at the end of each month, they could boost the user guided input stats, and this app would be a monster GPS tool. Like bigger than any of the other ones. Such a let down now. I know none of them are perfect, but Waze feels much closer to imperfection then many of the others. IMO It's sad "

I drove with the app on daily, made map edits, and marked every car stopped along side the road, big pothole and cop. So, I'm really confused why an app that was so great is now suffering a noticeable, steep decline in function and quality.Tell me if I'm off base here or if I'm the only person experiencing these issues:Drive sharing: You can still share a destination with 'friends' but they no longer see your live location and an accurate ETA.  My only regular Waze friend is my wife, and we use it know who will get home from work first (and take out the dog).  I used to know exactly where on her route she was and when she'd be home to the minute.  Now, I'll receive a notification that she's on her way home or to a store or whatever, but when I click on her in my friends menu it just gives her destination- the map doesn't show her live location anymore and the ETA is wrong- the ETA always shows the current time.  She could be driving an hour to work, and I know she's still a half hour away and the ETA will say the current time.  Routing around traffic: I usually take the interstate to and from work everyday, but there is an alternate route using a parallel rural US highway that would usually be about an extra 5 to 10 minutes longer.  I cannot count how many days this year I turned on Waze in my parking lot at work, it sent me home via the Interstate, and then a couple minutes later I found myself stuck in construction.  If I had only known about the construction and slowdown, I would have taken the US highway and been home way faster.  Waze apparently didn't catch that. There are a couple other issues too that I won't harp on, but it's just frustrating that something I used every day doesn't work as well as it did four years ago.  Am I the only one?  I'm on Android and my wife is an Apple person and has the same issues.  Is there another app out there with the same features but actually functions?

You can't choose which messages you would like to hear (I often only want speed warnings). The unable to connect to network message appears more often than before, I think the server's get overloaded.  No lane mapping either.       It's still my satnav of choice but increasingly I find myself using TomTom for the reliability of downloaded maps &amp; better UI and Google Maps because it is also more reliable provided you have some data connection and you are shown alternative routes.

The  claim that Waze learns the routes you prefer is simply not true - for maybe three years now it's been telling me to take a particular suicide left across a jam-packed four-lane street from a stop sign, which I always ignore, and instead go a block over to a traffic light to avoid it.   Years later, it still sends me to the suicide left stop sign.2. Every day leaving the house or work, it fails to give directions as it switches from WiFi to LTE.  This has been happening for years.3. In recent months, on multiple occasions I see Waze giving me a rush hour route IT KNOWS is bad news-it shows red streets, multiple heavy traffic reports, incidents etc on its chosen route ahead.  I take a right and a left onto a parallel street a very short block away which shows zero traffic, Waze adjust the route and suddenly the estimated drive time is three to six mins less on a 40min commute.4. Constantly takes me onto a parking lot 5mph freeway in preference to empty free flowing city streets, even for a short journey running errands.5. In short, it seems little use any more."

It's auto-reroute is top-notch.  The traffic data is just as good as anyone elses.   Of course no GPS is perfect but I'm a delivery driver and use this all the time.   You can also select blocks of traffic you may want to avoid.    It connects via bluetooth to get the traffic data.  If you're in /out of the vehicle all day like I am it may lose connection with bluetooth.   If your phone has a hotspot function you can just turn on your hotspot and the TomTom will connect by WiFi to your hotspot.&amp;#x200B;Garmin devices are great for road trips.  They have auto-rerouting too but only if it is significant.  If it's just 5 minutes or so it will give you the option for the new route but it won't make a sound or anything to alert you to the option.

I have several routes I can go home by, all of them usually congested to some degree.  The reports I have leaving my work are very inaccurate, and they are not accurate until I am closer to the juncture to where I have to decide.  So I end up refreshing different routes until I am close to having to decide.  Over the past couple of years of doing this I've noticed completely different results for different routes just in the matter of minutes and a few miles.

While some may not be pleased by that, there is the option to jump ship to Android and get a unit that has Android Auto too.

So far what I have working is shortcuts being able to automatically route me to my preset home and work addresses stored in the app. All you need to do is create a text command, then the next command should be to 'Open URLs.'  As an example, here is the link i am using for automatically navigating to work. If you replace the word 'work' with 'home' in this link, it will work just the same:   r/http://waze.com/ul?favorite=work&amp;navigate=yes  This is about as far as I have gotten.

They are probably needed less now since I am in an area with a mature map. Anyway, other than that I don't THINK they sacrifice anyone for the greater good. Traffic info is organized daily and per 10 minute (or so) block of time, so it is just possible that the math says it should be better.I know personally I turn myself into a guinea pig if I am not in a rush.

What is unfortunately the case a lot of times now is TOO MANY people are using Waze.Take the 495 beltway around the DC area (please).  It often gets backed up but often those backups are fairly fluid and move around and hot spots are short lived.   Now I'll often get Waze wanting me to detour through local streets in Bethesda area.  When it provides me with the detour, it's probably true that that route is faster NOW.  However, if it provides that detour to everyone else on the beltway, then traffic on the beltway drops and heavy traffic begins on the local streets as all the Waze users start following the detour.So sometimes you have to use your best judgement and decide what to do.  By the way, one thing I do is if I'm given a detour I try to swipe up on the map to look ahead. If I see reports of an accident then it's most likely unusual traffic, like closed lanes or even stopped traffic. In that case detouring is probably a good thing. If it just looks like normal heavy traffic, it's a lot less aggravating to stay put, and if you car has low-speed follow mode, let it do the stop and go dance! :-)"

Not sure that all those EV drivers would want the same directions.I know in my Bolt unless I'm driving >200 miles I don't even consider driving slower speeds to maximize range.I don't know how Waze routes cars differently based on their settings, maybe I should test it next time I'm going somewhere with my wife since we both use Waze and her's is not set on EV in theory it should give her different directions than me for the same destination (at least some of the time)."

There are definitely areas that Waze can (and should) improve the UI, but they do not have the kind of freedom that most people think that they do in order to make many UI refinements. Part of this is for the issues you mentioned (a variety of screen sizes, though Apple does not permit CarPlay with capacitive touchscreens), as well as vehicles that navigate via scroll wheels or joysticks rather than touchscreen. Apple abstracts all of that away and does not allow the developer to deal with those different input styles themselves.

How can you be certain that, since then, nothing at all has changed in your vehicle to render the results of that check invalid?  How can you be absolutely certain that, at any given moment in time, the speed shown on your speedo is definitely, without even the slightest shadow of doubt, accurate enough to avoid any legal issues?My point is, whilst in most/all regions there are legal requirements for the accuracy of vehicle speedos, there's absolutely no way to ensure these requirements are being met at all times, so having a means of measuring your vehicle speed which is entirely independent of any part of the vehicle systems is no bad thing especially given the rise of automated speed enforcement methods with reducing tolerances for being just a little bit over the limit.It can also be useful if you're driving different vehicles with different levels of speedo accuracy, e.g. to help you understand why other drivers seem to be going so much faster/slower than you are if you're used to driving a vehicle with a particularly accurate speedo and then start driving one which is far less accurate, or vice versa."

Using the rear wheel speed sensors you even have redundancy built in (two wheels).Besides, try using GPS as a source in tunnels. In fact built in navigation is using the wheel speed sensors for this as well as accelerometers for 'dead counting' to calculate long/lat movement in situations with no/weak GPS signal.The traditional signal source win in the long run unless you fully integrate with the vehicle."

If something isn't visible in the latest streetview imagery then it might as well not exist as far as GMaps is concerned.  You can spend as much time as you like gathering your own evidence of the existence of the changes, but with no obvious way to provide that evidence to Google then they take one look at the details they do allow you to enter via the standard change request form, compare it to what they already know, and quietly reject without any request for further information...  OTOH, you can fire up WME and (editing rights permitting) map out an entire new build estate for Waze in a matter of hours, and then see it made available in the app a few days later.I do like GMaps as a general purpose mapping tool, but unless they take user submissions of changes to the map data more seriously, and give us the ability to easily validate what we're saying has changed with photos, GPS track data etc, then the entirely crowd sourced approach to map maintenance that Waze have adopted will always win out in the end for anyone who cares that the map they're using right here and now is as up to date as it can possibly be.

        "body": "To expand on the previous answer slightly...  Yes, *if* it knows about them *and* there's an alternative route it's also aware of which looks to be a better choice at the time.Bear in mind that, unlike Google Maps navigation which is being fed with realtime traffic data from pretty much everyone in the area with an active Android phone, even if they're not using it for navigation, Waze gets data only from people actively using Waze.  If you're in an area with a high concentration of users, the realtime traffic data will then be on a par with Google's data, and  Waze's ability to route around traffic will seem like magic.  In areas with fewer users however, it can often seem like Waze is the dumbest navigator on the planet and will quite happily let you join the end of a lengthy traffic jam it simply wasn't aware of.It may also look like it's not working if, despite showing the traffic jam onscreen, it still routes you into the back of it rather than taking you on a different route.  Usually when this happens, it's either because the alternate route really is slower even without any traffic, or is also clogged up with traffic that Waze knows about but just hasn't shown on screen yet, and so sitting through the jam will then still get you to your destination faster than going another route even though it might not feel like it at the time...  One thing Waze doesn't however seem to to very well is to try and predict any further build up of traffic due to the jam it already knows about - e.g. if there's been an accident up ahead, this might currently only be adding a 5 minute delay at the point you join the back of the queue, but then 5 minutes later you're still stuck in the queue having not yet reached the point of the accident, because now the emergency services have arrived and closed off another lane to start recovery, or because the traffic ahead of you has just slowed down even more due to idiots rubbernecking instead of paying attention to the road ahead.  So there are times when it knows full well about what the current delay is for drivers who've just passed through the area, but where the actual delay to you as you just join onto the back of the queue can be considerably higher.But then there are times when it all works out better than predicted, because you've joined the queue just as it starts to clear again, so the estimated delay is considerably longer than your actual journey time...  So in my experience, the more you use Waze and place your trust in its routing decisions, the more likely you are to end up saving time overall."

When this occurs, relying on Waze for turn-by-turn directions (as I was doing while driving in an unfamiliar area last week), is rendered useless.In addition, the speed on Waze's speedometer will radically change every second; e,g., 55, 42, 73, 51, etc.Then the issue will go away and all is well.This is on an iPhone Xs Max, running iOS 12.0.1. By coincidence, I swapped the phone for a different color last week yet experienced the same issue on that phone, too!When the issue happened yesterday, I lauched Google Maps and saw the same issue there.

Not sure if it's a bug with the app itself, or with the way the map/closures edited on the back end.What I'm seeing is Waze routing me through known road closures, closures that are added to the Editor map as an 'Area' and the particular exit I was incorrectly routed to (Monroe St, exit 51 E off of the Eastbound Kennedy expressway).  The end of that segment/ramp dumps into the closure 'area' so one would think that would have it covered? Also, on the Waze live map the ramp correctly has the red/white pattern to denote the closure... Seems like this may just be an annoying bug of the app itself... any input from Editors or other Wazers seeing their apps route them through closures? "

Normally there's no way to know this happened other than as an editor seeing a ton of angry reports about being routed through closures during the time.  B) The default behavior for a closure is for Waze to route through it if it detects traffic passing through it.  This is a big problem in particular for roads that parallel another road, such as off ramps.  Waze may think cars on the open road are on the closed road, leading Waze to route through it.  You (or someone) needs to edit the closure in the editor and click the 'HOV/Service Road adjacent' flag to stop this from happening.

(I have some privacy concerns around why this is needed.)* Even with this set to always (for testing purposes) the calendar sync does not seem to work as it did in previous versions.

The problem seems to just be that the Devs started hiding most of this info from the end user, making the app far less useful as a general purpose navigation tool than it was originally - i.e. if you didn't want to have to plan a route and just wanted to navigate manually based on what was shown on screen.As for the other stuff, like the other responders have said I too haven't seen any loss of functionality either - in the UK we still get all the alerts and all the reporting options."

In contrast, ever since Google shut down the map maker project and restricted us to just being able to directly drag places around and having to submit change requests for everything else, the speed at which new stuff gets added to GMaps is even worse than it used to be.GMaps is good, but the more closed off it gets to its end users, the less enticing it is to me as someone who actually enjoys getting out there and exploring new build estates, checking new junction layouts and turn restrictions and all the other stuff Waze empowers us to push into the map database.

Ask your family and friends and you'll probably get a different answer from each. Also, a difficult turn in a rural area is usually a much shorter wait than one in an urban area.In Waze, a Difficult Turn (DT) adds a penalty on that particular turn for a majority of the day. Since there are not selectable hours, this alters the routing throughout most of the day. What is a difficult turn during the morning and/or evening rush hour might be just fine during mid-day and night.As a map editor, I have come to understand difficult turns to be 'dangerous' turns, which include turns that have little visibility when you need to look that way to turn.

I'm using my car's head unit, I'm not sure if the phone version acts differently. There are a few things that would make a huge improvement to the usability imo.1. Read out the report icon meaning and any comments when you press it on the map. The screen shows a green bubble to signify comments, but there is no way to see/hear what they say. Right the only way to see the comments is to unplug my phone, open Waze and scroll through to read what someone had said. Sometimes it's just friendly banter about how bad the traffic is, but sometimes it's actually helpful like 'car stopped in left lane.'2. Show next turn information when you press the direction box. I don't want to have to scroll the map to see my next turn or check which streets the route is taking me down. This is something Google maps does. "

If I leave my phone unplugged for several hours, my battery will drain rapidly, and Settings will indicate that Waze is responsible for a good chunk of my battery usage, which it shouldn't be, because my phone is always plugged in when I'm in my car.Seems like a bug or glitch in how Waze is detecting motion/inactivity in the background. I would guess it's a Waze issue, not an iOS 12 issue, but it could be related to both. Hopefully they realize it's happening and issue an update to resolve it soon.

After the event, you could also just submit a report via the app from wherever you are at the time, although you'd then need to be prepared to add a comment to explain whereabouts the problem actually was (reports are always geolocated at your current GPS position, no matter which part of the map you may be looking at in the app at the time).  You could also report it via the most appropriate regional sub-forum on waze.com, or as a last resort just post here describing exactly where the problem was and eventually it should get back to someone able to deal with it.Whilst it's also true that some users do have genuine problems with how the app or routing servers behave, this honestly isn't how Waze continues to behave for the majority of users, which is why there are so many of us more than happy to jump to Waze's defence whenever people bring up problems like this.  I'd be amazed if any of us were Waze employees, and other than the occasional t-shirt and other goodies handed out at the annual editor conferences we certainly don't get paid for supporting Waze, so accusations of being shills isn't going to go down too well.  There are literally millions of people around the world who use Waze daily because it's the best option for them, and thousands of those users are then only too happy to donate some of our spare time and energy to helping Waze out.  So yes, we're certainly passionate about Waze, but that doesn't make us shills.TL:DR Waze works just fine for most people, but when it doesn't there's a dedicated bunch of volunteer users willing to help out, provided the person needing help is willing to help us help them..."

As far as I know, when this happens you should receive an email to your registered Waze email (or possibly a message in your app inbox - I'm not 100% on the method of notification, just that one does exist) letting you know about the block and giving some instructions on how to go about getting it removed."

I've found many of the turn instructions are vague as well. 1000ft is really vague when there are 2-3 turns you could take all stacked on top of each other. Obviously there is a speed sensitive turn alerting system. I just think that the users should be able to change how much distance before that alerting system alerts you along with the changeover speed, and number of alerts before the turn. Each of those should be easy to implement and most people wouldn't change from the defaults anyway. But it would make the turn alerts much more intuitive."

If you're experiencing any difficulty pairing Waze with your Bluetooth system, please read our related Help Center article for troubleshooting tips.If you're not using one of the above methods, please try the following steps to remedy the issue:If you are using a voice that has including street names under the title, please tap Menu > and type cc@tts in the Search bar. This will clear your cache in Waze and should resolve the issue. To check if you're using this type of voice, tap Menu > Settings > Sound and check which voice you're using underneath Voice Directions.If you aren't using a voice that includes street names, please delete and reinstall Waze while connected to WiFi. Before deleting Waze, please make sure you have an email address linked  to your account should you need to reset your password in the future. Tap Menu > Settings > Account &amp; Login and tap Email.

I think it's prime time risk evaluation is taken to the very small increment of time level instead of depending on mass variables and large groups. A company like Waze could offer extremely personalized risk evaluation of drivers given the following advantages:1. Correlation of screen being on the Waze app while driving vs not inferring distracted driving time via phone2. Accelerometer data3. Speed data4. Miles drivin data5. Time of day driving and hours of day driving. All of these could help offer instintanious and mile by mile data which would lead to instintanious risk assessment. This could also promote safe driving in a finacial way besides traffic tickets. Both positive and negative enforcement combined is an extremely successful stratagy for changing behavior. I see some of the downsides but I think they could be resolved. I really don't know why this isn't a thing. Tl:drInsurance for drivers is based mostly on the group effect and metrics about a person that don't change that much. Why not correlate real time data collected about a driver to the amount of risk involved and induce a mile by mile (or moment by moment) insurance cost. "

But the main reason behind this law was to prevent prople from informing each other about where the cash machines, ahem, speed cameras, are located.Instead of an accurate position of the police control, Waze displays 'controleld areas', where one is likely to encounter a speed camera, but this is not accurate (each area covers about 3/4 of a mile...) and pretty uselessUntil last Sunday, version 3.7.7 was still working, allowing one to see exactly where a police check was.obviously, since Sunday, Waze did something, the only working versions are higher versions (which do not display police checks)"

Waze recognizing addresses. Will receive occasional notification if Waze had recently been opened.Possible Cause: Google's new adaptive battery, but more specifically, the bucket system it employs ([read more here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power)). Possible Solution: Manually assign Waze app to 'Active' bucket. 1. Follow these instructions [https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/](https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/)2. Go to the Waze app and select ActivePhone Details: Verizon Pixel 3, 128 gb, December update of Android 9Narrative:I have found adaptive battery to be beneficial (or at least not harmful) in maintaining my battery life, so I didn't necessary want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. But, I believe this to be a proximal cause of the Waze issue. In a little Saturday morning internet researching, I stumbled across the bucket system for adaptive battery ([link again here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power)). So the way I interpret Adaptive Battery is that based on the user's interaction with various applications (and, perhaps importantly, notifications), the system will assign apps into various buckets, ranging from 'this person never really uses this so keep it in check', to, 'this person uses this all the time, don't mess with it'. For me, I don't use Waze for navigation or anything else other then it's feature of telling me when I should leave before an event to get there on time. That is one of the crown jewels for my metric of a personal assistant. However, my use of Waze may be causing resources to be managed such that I don't receive those occasional notifications I desire. So, to cut to the chase, I manually assigned Waze into the 'Active' bucket so that adaptive battery would be nicer to it. And so far, it is working like a charm (for the last 3+ days). Now, please note: Google does not consider what I have done as a 'Best Practice', because I am not allowing the algorithm to do it's thing. And perhaps there are unintended consequences from what I've done. But I think that a tool is supposed to be helpful, otherwise it's a waste of time. [These very nice instructions](https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/) will guide you through the process. Go to the Waze app, and set it to Active. Working\\_Set may also work, but I haven't tried it. "

I can easily do either of these as a URL in the waze: url scheme (I'm on iPhone, Android is similar). Right now I have:waze://?favorite=School&amp;navigate=yes(Or, https://waze.com/ul?favorite=School&amp;navigate=yes)I have this in an iOS 12 shortcut along with a podcast play directive and it does exactly what you'd expect.I'd really like to be able to do something like:waze://?favorite=Work&amp;AddStopFavorite=School&amp;navigate=yesAlso, I'd like this to work with search and location parameters (q=, ll=) in addition to favorites."

The problem today is if you decide to shut off notifications you may not notice that there is a deviation on the route and missed the exit to avoid traffic."

(I wish I had a screen shot to post) These buttons are small and close together which forces me to really concentrate on the phone and not the road. I'd love to see them be bigger, more contrasted in color and separated...maybe one right, one left or one top, one bottom...to make it easier to quickly look up and poke the proper button."
