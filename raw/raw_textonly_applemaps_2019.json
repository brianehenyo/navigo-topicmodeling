I tend to ignore those completely. And luckily for my work, I don't need them at all. \n\nBut for *finding* places, Foursquare is still the winner. But whether the place is *worth* finding?

It's probably time I did another series of controlled comparisons.\n\nThe big difference with Foursquare, as compared to all the others, is that Foursquare will have all the *little* things. It won't just know about the big mall, it'll know about a bunch of the free standing market stalls inside the mall, it'll know the motosai win bike station outside the BTS, the little hole-in-the-wall laundrette which barely even has a name, the little square of garden next to the intersection that barely qualifies as a park. People enter every little thing into it, regardless of whether it is \"significant\" or not.\n\nSo for example in my condo, Foursquare doesn't just know about my condo, it knows about the gym, the communal lounge area, and the pool, all as separate points of interest (or \"venues\", in Foursquare's terminology). And it wasn't me who put those in there either. It even knows the silly names the condo gave to the gym and the communal lounge.\n\nI suspect a lot of marketing teams have entering stuff into Foursquare as part of their job. So the things big enough to have marketing teams will all be in there.

If you think Apple should integrate a large external dataset or you have suggestions for improving the app itself, email maps_escalations@apple.com\n2.\tApple also like to hear about structural issues that are region-specific. Send these to maps_support@apple.com\n3.\tIf you are really invested in getting a list of POIs added to Maps, your best bet is to file reports inside Maps for every one.\n\n#### Getting POI data from OSM\nOpenStreetMap data is really good for some regions and categories of POI. To get this data for reporting to Apple Maps:\n1.\tIn the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity), find the `amenity` value for the category of POI you want to export.\n2.\tGo to [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)\n3.\tAt the top, select `wizard`\n4.\tAs search query, enter the value and region. For example, `\"drinking water\" in \"New Zealand\"`. For this search, enter the OSM amenity value with spaces instead of underscores, but be sure to put quotes like I did.\n5.\tSelect `build query`\n6.\tIn the code, change `timeout:25` to `timeout:1000`\n7.\tAt the top, select `run` and wait. This will probably take less than three minutes.\n8.\tIf the server responds with an error stating high memory use, change your query to a smaller area, like a city or province and re-run.\n9.\tAt the top, select `export`\n10.  Choose `download as gpx` and save the file on your device.\n11. Rename the file to something descriptive and add the `.gpx` file suffix. You will not be able to change the file name later on. For example `drinking_water-nz.gpx`\n12. On [gpx2kml](https://gpx2kml.com/), upload and convert the file using the default settings.\n13. Download the kml file, but **do no rename it!** This breaks compatibility.\n\n#### Filing a whole bunch of reports\nKML data acquired like this can be reported to Maps relatively efficiently on iPhone:\n1.\tDownload [KML Collection](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/kml-collection-import-maps/id1337982582?l=en&amp;mt=8)\n2.\tImport the KML file and select it from the app's main list.\n3.\tEither in the list or map screen, iterate through the POIs you want to report:\n-\tSelect a POI and tap `Open in Apple Map`\n-\tIn Maps, zoom all the way in to the pin\n-\tClose the pin's overlay so the pin disappears, but remember its location\n-\tSee if a corresponding POI already exists for the POI you want to report.\n-\tIf you didn't see a corresponding POI, you might want to search for it by name. Sometimes, POIs are mapped at the wrong location, are overlapped by another POI, or randomly don't show up on the map. \n-\tPress and hold where the pin was to create a new pin\n-\tScroll the overlay and select `Report an Issue` \u2192 `Add a Place` \u2192 `Business or Landmark`\n-\tOn the `Move the map to the correct location` screen, you can set a fine-grained location. This might not be necessary depending on the accuracy of your original dataset. Also be aware that satellite imagery is not always correctly aligned in Maps, unless your area has high-resolution Flyover imagery. You should check accuracy of your area by cross-referencing with road map view.\n-\tComplete the form and Submit.\n\n#### Best practices\n-\tFor new locations, research the POI online. If there's an official page, put it in the URL field. If it's a government-owned property like a park or city hall without its own web page, the city's generic URL is fine. Facebook pages are generally not considered acceptable for the URL field.\n-\tIf you're on an HTTP web page, try changing the protocol to HTTPS. If the site supports it, you should always link the secure URL.\n-\tIf you're reporting a missing business and there's no official site, provide Apple staff with a way to prove its existence. This can be a photo, Facebook link, news article or telephone number. \n-\tThe phone number field doesn't require a specific format.\n-\tThe opening hours field doesn't require a specific formatting, but you can make the staffer's life easier. For example, good formatting is `Mo-We 10:00-12:30 &amp; 17:30-22:00; Fr-Sa 10:00-13:00`. Apple Maps represents opening times as ranges of days of the week, with each day-range containing one or multiple time ranges. There is no support for holidays, seasonal hours, etc. The only exception to this format is `Open 24h` which you can add to anything that doesn't close like parks, public restrooms or McDonald's.\n-\tCategories are a mess. Many of them are duplicates or very similar but separate. There is no official guidances and Apple staff don't seem to know either. The category you select rarely gets changed by the staffer who reviews your issue. When selecting a category for a new POI, just try to stay in line with similar ones already mapped. The POIs around Apple Campus are probably closest to Apple's best practices.\n-\tPOIs should be placed near the center of where its structure appears on the map. Entry points are set separately using either a POI with category \"Entry\", or by reporting a navigation issue.\n-\tPlease don't stack POIs. If you encounter a POI that is obscured by another POI on top, move on them to the side while staying near the center of the building.\n-\tIn a POI's title, remove descriptive text or anything that is already represented in other fields. *Caf\u00e9 Seaside - Coffee and More* should be just *Seaside*, with its category being *Caf\u00e9*. Once exception are business names that contain puns with the category name like *Q-Bar*.\n-\tIf possible, stick to title case. All-caps names are suitable for big brands that have consistent capitalisation in their branding style guides, but usually not individual coffee shops.\n-\tFor POIs contained inside larger structures, or to express association with a university, you can use the vertical-slash `Library | University of Michigan` formatting. The additional info is often not necessary if the POI is part of a bigger campus, or of a shopping centre that has its own POI. In general, keep it short.\n-\tDashes are also useful, mostly for non-business POIs that need a bit of explanation. For example `Old phone booth - Community Book Box`\n-\tAbbreviations can be put in braces if you put the full name in front. Like in German `Volkshochschule (Vhs)`"}, {"id": "ehpqllj", "body": "Do **not** do this - OpenStreetMaps' license requires that you share all of any data set you integrate its data with.

Where Google Maps will usually update location info almost immediately, it takes Apple Maps so much longer to update.

I have reported this issue to Apple, but they have not updated the route or contacted me back.\n\n**Unable to Highlight City/Neighborhoods**: Google Maps allows you to click on just about any location, be it a city name or neighborhood, and it will highlight that specific region on the map and provide whatever info is available on it.  Apple Maps requires you to type in a location to pull it up, but even then, it does not highlight the region on the map.  \n\nI have been trying to give Apple apps and services an opportunity, but time and time again, they come up short.

The **turn-by-turn** may be limited to other countries at the moment due to because of licensing and poor data coverage. Apple\u2019s goal is combating this limitation by rebuilding their Maps data from the ground-up by collecting data from their satellite imagery and improving their AI machine on details like grasses, trees, mountains, golf course fields, deserts, beaches, lakes, rivers, &amp; oceans. It is also combined with a little help from Apple Maps Team to make the structures more accurate. The most effective mapping system to their game is also from their Imagery Collection Car driving the roads in every corners of the road driving 1000\u2019s of miles/km. Recently, they been using Subaru Impreza to scan the roads of the selected [Countries](https://maps.apple.com/imagecollection/locations/us). Their goal is to make their own mapping system their own data so that reports can process faster, make it usable for the consumers, to reveal more structures, for features to be readily available to other countries and catch-up to it\u2019s rival which is GM.

For jailbreaking, the data for unlocking more road structures or street view to maps is coming from GM completely, so it has nothing to do with Apple holding back to releasing its own data yet because they are just starting to survey other countries and building the structures from the ground up to acquire their own data. GM was ahead before AM was born, they been relying on their street view vehicles and satellites imagery for years and GM almost covered every part of the countries in the world. Which is why they are able to do turn-by-turn, street view &amp; high quality imagery with all that simply working with their own data. Apple is completely aware that their Maps app are empty, limited, and still inaccurate. Tim Cook even released an apology letter back then for having a bad Maps app and now they are continuing to improve  Maps in a different way and will never back down and shut down their maps app for being horrible and taking the public\u2019s criticism, it\u2019s because they had a vision for Maps and they will continue that progress to make it a reality."}, {"id": "cwaops", "body": "I'm a little bit curious if anyone has noticed any expansion of the Real-time transit feature to new transit agencies since the first iOS 13 beta?

You will see which one is for only money, which ones are helping the world.\nApple one is just all overprice products and try to manage privacy image (even with Siri privacy issue). When you watch to their keynote, not really give you a wow and inspirational feeling like Google or Microsoft 's products, features or AI stuff working on. Just about maps, Google also has AR feature supported for maps  and much more feature to help users out. Apple knows that their phone and products are not as good as before, so they need to change their business to service based, to be a \"iBank\". For the business on apple Maps, businesses cannot even put their flexible or seasonal hours on it, lots of them are frustrating and still relying on third party data. Just a very simple thing still cannot do so on the maps, users cannot put two pins on maps for directions, on apple maps, still only can put one purple pin then choose a random nearby business for directions, and even cannot easily copy the coordinates without using sharing function. Sometime not necessary to be overly fancy, but at least they need to listen to their users and put simple features then individual and business users need.\nWe will see what \"innovation\" they will have in Sept event. A copied three cameras phone, still with a huge notch. But two products I love from apple are iPad and iwatch, real innovation and good products, I agree. By the way, I use apple products for work every day, use Microsoft and google stuff for daily life, so I know the differences.

When i watch google keynotes, all I do is worry about how it\u2019s going to collect data from me. How it\u2019s monetized. With Apple, they\u2019re transparent about the cost by putting it into dollars. With google, they try to obfuscate how much the services are worth. Your attention is their product, and they make money by selling it to companies who want you to buy stuff.\n\nMicrosoft has issues because they refuse to move on from their heyday because their clients refuse to love on from their heyday.

But to equate that to what google does isn\u2019t even in the same ballpark.\n\nYou mention most websites have cookies and that it makes avoiding tracking futile. Apple seems to be aware of this, and uses AI to block those cross-site trackers. They also limit and inform what data is being taken by different apps, and in iOS 13 show a map of where an app wanted your location. Using Apple products and using Apple services BOTH make a difference. If you use google for everything, it\u2019ll be smaller.\n\nI don\u2019t find AR maps useful as I don\u2019t really want to hold my phone up on from of me while navigating.

So, I drive a 2015 Nissan Rogue SV and it does not have an after-market head unit, it's using the standard one that does not have Apple CarPlay functionality. I am running iOS 13.1 beta on my iPhone XS Max, however, I've been having this issue since I was on stable iOS 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue I'm having is that when driving with Apple Maps giving directions, Siri is super quiet to the point where I have no damn clue what she's saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn `Settings &gt; Maps &gt; Driving &amp; Navigation &gt; Navigation Voice Volume`, I have this set to `Loud Volume`... yet the issue still persists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe navigation voice prompts are playing over bluetooth to the head unit in my car and like most people, I like to listen to music while I'm driving. I have Apple Music and I'll have my music playing over bluetooth. So this is exactly what happens:\n\n* The music is playing from my phone to car via bluetooth\n* The music volume is automatically lowered\n* Apple Maps (Siri) gives navigational voice prompt... yet really quietly\n* The music volume goes back to what it was before\n\nSo the music volume is lowered like it should be, yet Siri is still talking really quietly. In fact, when I'm using Apple Maps and I'm NOT listening to music, she talks even QUIETER which makes zero sense!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to Google and I tried searching for what could be the issue. Basically the only thing I could find was that I should try turning up the volume of my head unit while Siri is actually speaking, because that should be changing the Siri volume, not my music volume. Except, this morning, I literally tried that, and it did not work at all. When I tried this, it just turned up the overall volume in my car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only solution that I have is to not play music in my car while using Apple Maps and to turn up my car's volume to like the absolute max so I can actually hear what the hell she's saying. I'm at a loss and this is really annoying. I don't have this issue at all with Google Maps (have not tried Waze) yet I would really like to use Apple Maps because I have an Apple Watch and I find the directions appearing on my watch to be super useful. Also, there have been a few times earlier this year when I was driving somewhere and Google Maps failed me (gave directions too late, gave wrong turns, etc), while on the same drive another time, Apple Maps worked much better\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what's going on? Is it just my car being dumb? Should I result to my car's owner manual and try to reset the head unit completely and see if that works? Should I just purchase an Apple CarPlay head unit and have it installed in my car? Any help is greatly appreciated."}, {"id": "f0x9ywr", "body": "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Apple Maps new coverage data have dramatically improved over the past 4 years since they\u2019ve begin collecting imagery by their image collecting vehicles.

Traffic Data is as good as Waze now and before you even hit Go on Maps it already automatically suggest you to a faster route and brings you away from heavy traffic. My relative used GMaps when we were on a road trip and comparing our Maps, since they trusted alot on GMaps, GMaps brought us to an exit where there was a tbone accident even tho it already knows that it was on red, meanwhile on Apple Maps, it was bringing us to the next exit to get away from the toxic traffic and accident, and it was clear to me Apple\u2019s navigation software have improved and why people\u2019s opinions are is wrong. Siri\u2019s improved guidance phrases is no compared to any other Maps now and it is much easier to understand. People in the internet says that GMaps is the better choice and doesn\u2019t get you lost but honestly Apple Maps got alot of better than Gmaps when it comes to navigating and the details of the new coverage is much more useful. Most of the Uber drivers that I\u2019ve encountered who uses Gmaps still gets lost in downtowns and tried them using Apple Maps, the lane guidance was very useful and the clear voice directions of Siri seemed like it helped them so much they dropped me off to my destination without a fuss. But I would say Apple is not behind, they are competitive now, people are just bias over Maps about being worse from the beginning but the past is the past and Apple have improved and learn over the years.

If I get stuck in traffic while navigating with Apple, I will always open Waze to see the cause of the traffic, the speed traffic is moving, and where it clears up.

Siri would tell you ahead to suggest you a faster route if it detects traffic jam. My experience with Waze is the navigation takes you to residential areas just to save a minute where Maps only takes you to Highways and High speed highways which is safer and easier. Another thing I don\u2019t like about Waze services is the Ads popping up every-time and the lack of lane guidance.\n\nI only like using Waze on backgrounds for telling me things like police, object on road, vehicle stop on road, &amp; vehicle on shoulder. \n\nI believe that Maps traffic data is much more accurate now since they calculate your speed on our iPhone, iPad, iPod &amp; Apple Watch in a anonymous fashion. The M7-M12 motion coprocessor is what makes it more accurate for Maps and the majority of people using an Apple device. So I trust Maps more, when it comes to traffic because of this advanced hardware taking into software. \n\n&gt; If I\u2019m just curious about traffic in general, I frequently open both Apple &amp; Google.

No more green lines no more this darker color &amp; lighter color, it is just simplicity. That\u2019s why I dislike of Google so much because they keep adding features on their Maps services and makes it bloated like iTunes and recently I\u2019ve noticed GMaps is becoming slower in terms of experience. Yes, it has more features but not all of those are really practical IMO. Future is about minimalistic and a good design where it is easy to understand for everyone. \n\n&gt; Apple is my preference for general navigation because I prefer the voice &amp; UI, but it absolutely is not the best for detailed information.\n\nApple Maps is the best when it comes to detailed information. The most noticeable detailed is the cartography of Maps and the new Look Around. Transit and walking directions is coherent. Lane Guidance, traffic light and stop signs directions are seamless. It tells you if they accept Apple Pay, informations from Yelp, reservation for Open Table, Information from Trip Advisor. The parking POI are much easier to see than GMaps especially when you\u2019re in downtown.

If you want us to email you, Apple, then make the report a problem button open up a new email to wherever you want us to email you. If all we can do is correct business hours and add listings then that\u2019s fine.

Even with the new collections feature in iOS 13, the locations sync do not work properly.

When the maps app has zero locations marked in favourites (like a clean slate), it works well. Once it reach hundreds of locations, it stop allowing adding more. Even if a location is added, it disappears when the app reopens. Sometimes when i'm lucky, it gets added &amp; synced between my iPhone &amp; iPad. \n\n2. The problem persisted in iOS 13 when collections are introduced. Adding a location to a collection doesn't always get added. Sometimes it manages to be added but on reopening the app, it disappears. \n\n3. I started out iOS 13 on my iPad &amp; began to build collections ranging from 10-400 locations. I was keen to move my lists in Google Maps over to Apple. When i upgrade my iphone too to iOS 13, my collections on the iphone appears but with no locations in them. That was heartbreaking. Luckily, the collections on my iPad still retain the locations. Since then adding new locations does not sync between the devices even they are on the same iCloud ID. \n\nI have switched on and off my iCloud before. and also on and off Maps in iCloud.

As with any news related to Apple Maps, they seem like ghosts of the past and hateful comparisons to Google Maps. 6 years to launch the new maps? Only in the San Francisco area at the moment? Why don't you do iPhones and leave maps to companies like Google that are more advanced?\n\nFrom the point of view of a person external to the project, it is difficult to understand the decisions that are made. From a user's point of view, it is even more difficult to understand the decisions a company makes with thousands of engineers and experts who will probably have done dozens of market studies and know their own plans better than anyone in the medium and long term. Despite this, some doubts can be cleared now that several years have passed since the release of Apple Maps and following the announcement of the new version.\n\nWhy did Apple set aside Google Maps in 2012?\n\nWith how well Google maps were going on iOS, right? The switch from Google Maps to Apple Maps meant a significant reduction in quality in the moment. The maps were riddled with errors and often the application was virtually unusable. So much so that Tim Cook had to go out and apologize and Scott Forstall was dismissed.\n\nApple knew that its own maps would not live up to Google's from the outset, however there were compelling reasons to take the plunge. It's all about the licenses Google offered. Continuing to use Google maps in the long run was untenable by existing limitations. For example, maps were used in bitmap and not vector, so the zoom was reduced and had a limit. Nor could you use turn-by-turnnavigation, another feature that Google Maps limited to third parties such as Apple. Privacy? All the information collected by the old maps went to Google.\n\nIn short, Apple found itself in a position where to continue offering an updated map service and with news, it hadto abandon Google maps. A step back at first, but fortunately it would allow them to evolve in the medium and long term without relying on others.\n\nWhat does this new Apple Maps mean compared to what we already have?\n\nApple Maps' current maps also come from third parties, such as TomTom or OpenStreetMap. Although the limitations are no longer as strict as using a single system like Google's, they do still exist. For example, whenever an error is found or you want to add a change, it has to be approved by third parties such as OpenStreetMap. Hence, if you suggest a change in Apple Maps it can take months to complete while on Google Maps it's a matter of days or even instant if you're a verified profile.\n\nUsing TomTom or OpenStreetMaps licenses during these years has been an intermediate step,until they had time to make their own maps. An intermediate step in which they have been able to add new features to Apple Maps, but for the integration to be complete, they have created their own maps. Much more detailed maps, with options that they would not have been able to add depending on others.\n\nSix years to make this decision?\n\nThe argument of \"the company with the most money in the world and is not able to...\" it is very common to appear whenever Apple takes longer than we would like to develop a service or product. The development of a product unfortunately depends not only on the economic factor or capital available, but also on aspects that cannot be controlled,such as time. In the Apple Maps timeline we have something more or less like this:\n\nIn 2012 they launched Apple Maps with OpenStreetMap maps\nIn the following months they check that it is still not the product they expected, so they begin to develop their own solution.\nIn the following years they develop the tools and technologies of their own to create an Apple Maps from scratch (vans, recognition software, APIs...). At the same time they improve apple maps today.\nStepped launch in 2018, starting with San Francisco.\n\nGlobal arrival in the coming years.\n\nAccording to Eddy Cue, they've been working on these new maps for four years. In these four years they have not only walked the vans through San Francisco, but they have developed all the necessary infrastructure to be able to create the new maps. So, in principle, the most complicated part has already been done and now all that remains is to expand the maps. Apple has been walking its vans around the world for years, including Spain.\n\nAnd why not a worldwide launch?\n\n\"And why haven't they waited a little longer to make a global launch?\" Making such a worldwide throw of such caliber is not only naive, but stupid. These things are usually deployed gradually in order to have a control of the process. Or does Google Maps look just as good all over the world? Do we have Street View on every street in the world?\n\nApple Maps Some differences between the current Apple Maps and the upcoming Apple Maps now available in San Francisco.\nEddy Cue told TechCrunch:\n\nWe have a dedicated team, we started this four years ago, in a variety of fields from ML to map design, so to speak. There are thousands of people working on this all over the world from here in the Bay Area, to Seattle, Austin, New York. We have people in other countries, in cities like Berlin, Paris, Singapore, Beijing, Malmo, Hyderabad.\n\nBut Google Maps follows light years from Apple Maps\n\nOne detail I found interesting about these new Apple maps is a phrase said by Eddy Cue, current head of Apple Maps:\n\nWe don't think anyone's doing something like what we're doing.\n\nMaking such a statement with such certainty gives you to think. A manager of one of the most important companies in the world does not release as well as such a phrase, he has to be sure that neither Google nor other map companies have achieved or are achieving similar results.\n\nLIDAR Apple vans have been using the lidar system since 2015.\nAt the moment the most significant changes that we see users are more green and detailed areas in the maps, but they are creating the basis for many other features. For example, Apple vans have been using lidar technology since 2015, google Maps only deployed last year. With lidar can for example calculate the exact height of each building, so the Flyover view of Apple Maps will have the exact floors and exact meters of each building, Google gets an approximate height via the satellite currently.\n\nBut there's so much more, Apple's new maps are named after street stores and public buildings thanks to photographs captured by Apple vans. They don't rely on information collected from thousands of users who spend time in those stores and cafes, as Google Maps does.\n\nSpeaking of privacy, the millions of iPhones around the world will also help build Apple's new maps. However, they won't like Google Maps, which has full histories of routes and locations of users. Apple Maps sends only segments of a route you take,and those segments are completely anonymous. This way not only do they not know who the user is, but they do not even know the full path that he has performed, just random pieces. Don't you want them to even know that? You can turn it off in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services &gt; System Services &gt; Improve Maps.\n\nIn recent years the only reason I've opened Google Maps on my iPhone is to check somewhere in Street View. All the directions and routes I've done have been with Apple Maps and I haven't had any problems with it. Google Maps offers information about business and Street View, but the fallacy that Apple Maps leaves you at random points on the planet, we can put it aside. In any case, you are not required to use Apple Maps, and luckily there is always the option to use Google Maps, HERE Maps or any other service available in the App Store."}, {"id": "dzbvlh", "body": "Over the last 2 days, my Apple maps app has stopped working when I\u2019m off WiFi.

Nowhere in any iOS app on the iPhone will you find a different action button colour, except Maps.\n\n&gt;From my understanding, the GO button \u2018depicts\u2019 a traffic light.
