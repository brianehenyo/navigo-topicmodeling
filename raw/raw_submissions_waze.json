It's that bad.  If you've changed UX lead in the past few years then whomever is in charge of hiring them should also be fired.  \n\nPlease consider hiring a UX consulting team with a solid reputation to come fix your UX and then have them help you hire a competent person on your behalf.  \n\nCredit where credit is due.  You fixed this a while ago, but I don't want you to think it went unnoticed.  Thank you for getting rid of the invisible button to control the sound.  \n\nNot having invisible buttons should be a no brainer.  Thankfully that was just a nitpick not the end of the world.  It didn't make the app  unsafe. \n\nSadly, the UI you currently have is both less usable and unsafe.\n\n**The floating instruction bar in horizontal mode.**\n\nOne of the most important rules of UX design is that you do not move elements on your UI based on user input.  \n\nI.e. it is in bad form to have a button that moves when the user moves his/her mouse.   A real world example of this would be in OSX when you move your mouse towards the toolbar and the icon magnifies.  It's a nitpick in this example but it's not the end of the world.\n\nUnfortunately for your app this is more of a safety concern.  You have this floating instruction bar and the map is moving based on the vehicle's GPS data.  For all intents and purposes you're moving the floating instruction bar all over the map.  \n\nSo when I come to a stop light and need to turn left do I need to turn left immediately or in 30 feet? I can't tell because you're covering that aspect of the screen.  GPS isn't always perfectly accurate so it helps to know if I need to take the first turn or the 2nd turn.\n\nLock the tool bar to the top as it was before and we don't need to deal with this frustration again.  \n\nFinally, not having the car centered is simply in poor taste.  \n\n\n**Ads**\n\nThey pop up right on the information that I am using when I am driving.  Maybe consider having these pop up when I'm not going to have to turn in 50 feet?  That would be wonderful.  Better still maybe have them slide on the bottom and replace the bottom toolbar for a few seconds.  This way it's not ever going to be over crucial information that people are glancing at when they are performing a more risky maneuver IE turning is complicated and prone to accidents then simply driving straight.  \n\nWhile I haven't had any accidents while using this because obviously I prioritize avoiding accidents over following directions.  It's frustrating when I'm in an unfamiliar area and end up taking a wrong turn, because when I glanced at the screen to briefly get the important information I needed it was not visible to me.  \n\nPersonally I've found myself using your app less and less because it is less usable.

I say this because this was sort of my fault for taking a couple wrong turns and not trusting my gut when I should have. \n\nI was on my way back from a restaurant that\u2019s 30 minutes away from my house by using a toll road. My cell phone reception sucked going out of the parking garage, and it took a while to readjust, however when it did, I managed to find myself on the toll road that was needed.\n\nEverything was going fine, but Waze hadn\u2019t readjusted to tell me to continue down this toll road. Instead, Waze wanted me to switch into the airport traffic lanes for my nearby airport. This is also where I messed up by not trusting my gut, because I thought Waze probably knew something that I didn\u2019t. So I switch into those lanes. \n\nWaze wanted me to get back onto the toll road that ran parallel to this lane that I was in, however this way was closed. So, Waze took me all the way to the airport and around the rented car lots and all that. At this point, I\u2019m sort of stressed out because I realized that I had essentially piggybacked off the toll road for free without going through a toll plaza, which is of course illegal. \n\nSo, I ended up home safe and sound. Waze technically did its job. However, I don\u2019t use Waze that often at all since I\u2019m young and I usually only drive short distances around my town. Because of that, I did not know I could file a map issue report. I\u2019m lucky I was not caught, but I\u2019m surprised Waze took me on a route to freeload the toll road. I do realize there\u2019s a lot of people who finesse the toll road in the exact same way though. I wish I had known better to report the map issue and to follow my gut and stay on the familiar road.\n\nTL;DR Because I was dumb, and took a wrong turn, Waze had me loop around my nearby airport, basically having me piggyback the toll road for free, which is illegal.", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "dsbjvee", "body": "Finesse used in this manner is that generation's best contribution to society.", "author": "setmehigh", "score": 5, "created": "2018-1-7", "permalink": "/r/waze/comments/7oqkyn/waze_had_me_take_an_illegal_route_last_night/dsbjvee/", "parent_id": "t3_7oqkyn"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "dsbov6z", "body": "Just curious: do you have \"Avoid toll roads\" turn on in nav options?\n\nAnd - Dulles?\n\nThe toll enforcement there is notoriously haphazard.

For whatever reason, any driver using the waze app tries to drop me off in a back alley on Congress st. This is also true for almost every address in this section of summer street.\n\nThe problem is that Summer street is a raised road two stories above the street level of congress street. None of the buildings in this alleyway offer public access to get to Summer st. The only way to get to Summer st on foot is to walk to the far side by the fort point channel or be a local and know about a specific public access stairwell under one of the bridges.\n\n- Being dropped off in this unlit alleyway is sketchy and dangerous at certain times of day\n- It adds a huge amount of time for me personally to walk such a huge extra distance just to get into my building.\n- Anyone being dropped off here not familiar with the area is basically stranded since they wont know about the stairwell or how to get around.\n\n[This is a google street view link of what summer street looks like from congress street](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3495983,-71.0472944,3a,54.2y,221.29h,90.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sB-vQGl7q_tQQulH5XlQmwg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). (RES users need to click it or they wont get a street view version) It is clearly visibly not accessible from congress street.\n\nMy workaround for this has become to assume drivers will be using waze and put in an address of the convenience store on the corner of summer and melcher to trick the app into navigating me correctly.  But today I used the lyft line option and the poor girl who I rode in with also had an address on summer st. and the driver tried to drop her in that same alleyway and she had no idea what was going on.\n\nAll I want is for waze to send people to the actual address of the building entered and not a \"close enough\" point that leaves us stranded having to walk.

Or (also with an Waze account) post in the offical [Massachusetts forum](https://www.waze.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=618) and ask if someone could do that for you. A local area manager could also help to tell you if it's a good idea to remove the bridge status from the street.\n\nFinally a small rant: Isn't it possible to tell the driver about the problem so they don't blindly go by the navigation software? I don't have Uber where I live, but my experience with taxi drivers is that they listen to the wishes of the guest, or are flexible with the price, if they did drive you to the wrong place.

I once got a response with \"well that's not showing on Google street view\" and it just blew my mind because I remember a time when using any other source was a huge no-no. Or I've found where the AM marks a turn as not allowed when it is and when I try to correct it I'm told that the map is more efficient to have that turn be not allowed. My theory had always been mark the roads as they are and let the algorithm figure it out. The AMs near me have a different idea and IMO they seem to be ruining the app. I also find them to be toxic to the community.\n\nMaybe you can reach out to your AM directly, maybe you'll have more luck than I.

It used to be very smooth but now I can hardly follow the map when I prepare to make a turn. I think this issue started sometime after my phone automatically updated to Android 8 Oreo but I can't recall exactly when. I've done a master reset but the problem is still there. What is reaaaally interesting is that whenever I press the orange action button to point something on the map, it suddenly works like a charm for like 3-4 seconds and then back to stuttering. It's so frustrating since it used to work perfectly and I can see it still does with the trick I explained.\n\nAny ideas what is making the app so laggy?

I got two different routes, depending on where I was in the parking lot. Each started on the closest point on the road to my current location, and routed in the proper direction. In the first of the two images, the navigation started on a road that doesn't actually connect to the parking lot, but that's okay, because I can see the route, I can see where I am in relation to the route, and I can get myself onto one of the connecting roads headed in the right direction.

If you then try responding to the email itself, as would seem to be the obvious thing to do, rather than via the inbox within the Waze app, your email gets silently ditched by the Waze mail server without ever being seen by the editor who responded.  \n\nSo if you do get a response which is asking for further details to help the editor understand the problem, it's vital to reply via the app in order for your reply to get back to the editor.\n\n\nBut tbh, if it's a problem that has the potential to require some back and forth discussion, provision of photos or other supporting evidence etc, then going via the forums is so much easier, and if your local editing community is as active in the forums as we are over here, it gives your problem a very good chance of being seen by someone who understands what the problem is and has the necessary editing rights to do something about  it.", "author": "twister-uk", "score": 3, "created": "2018-8-1", "permalink": "/r/waze/comments/93h8wg/is_it_possible_to_have_waze_avoid_a_specific/e3dr4vw/", "parent_id": "t1_e3dmulm"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e3dsxf7", "body": "I've seen Waze tout this feature and I think it is vaporware.

For example a node not far before an intersection for a side road to go into a gas station or other parking lot can pollute the data if there's a lot of right turns that don't wait for the light much.

The left and straight movements both go straight over the first junction at the lower right in the square, then the left goes left at the top right of the box.

I\u2019ve tried powering down and turning back on the phone, turning airplane mode on/off and resetting network settings and they were all temporary fixes if they worked at all. The solution that I\u2019ve found that works best for me when I really need to rely on the GPS is that I have to turn off LTE. So I currently am using iOS 11.4.1 and go to Settings&gt;Cellular&gt;Cellular Data Options&gt;Enable LTE&gt;Off and then it will turn off the LTE radio antenna or something and go to the 4G network. Download speed sucks, but the gps doesn\u2019t get lost every 5 minutes.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve considered jumping to the Android platform since the issues have become worse and worse. I went from the original Samsung Galaxy S to the iPhone 5 and then to the 6s. The appeal to me was that between the OEM and the Cell service network providers here in the USA, there was no advantage to release android OS updates or it became finger pointing by different companies as to why phone software updates would get held up for one reason or another and the end user would be left holding the bag. \n\nPissed off, I jumped to the iPhone because they didn\u2019t have issues with getting OS updates. I also naively thought that with less handset models to adapt OS and software to since Apple controls the hardware and software, that I would have a superior experience as the end user. Well somewhere along the way, somebody has fucked up. I know it\u2019s not just me, but many iPhone users that have GPS and Cell connection problems. Between the service provider and Apple, who else is there to pass the buck/accountability on to since they control everything. How does this happen? A simple google search, YouTube search, or Reddit search amongst iPhone subreddits will reveal that many users have experienced these same problems and even developers in Apple discussion forums that are working with iOS 12 are already having problems. Again, Apple and ATT are the only people that can be blamed, right? And Apple controls the hardware and software and yet there seems to be no solution or fix in sight nor an official acknowledgement of widespread issues. It\u2019s bullshit and those two companies know it and say nothing. They are both complicit with a shitty user experience as they lean back and count their money. What good is a connected smart device - if it\u2019s not connected? If I don\u2019t see something change, I\u2019ll go to the Android handset for my next phone. They have dropped the ball here. The incentive of paying a premium for the iPhone experience has diminished significantly when the antennas, gps and software lose function or don\u2019t work together.

I'm sure what happens to me or my town won't be the same for everyone, but here's what I'm noticing.\n\nLong time Wazer, back to almost when it started, but not a beta tester or anything like that.  What I've noticed, however, is that now that Waze &amp; Google Maps has gotten so popular, and everyone and I mean EVERYONE is using it now....when an incident occurs on the main route into our downtown area during rush hour, for example, Waze directs you to an alternate route.  This used to work great.  However, I've noticed with its popularity (comes great responsibility, heh) the alternate route method has become almost unusable. I say that because the moment it tells EVERYONE to use the alternative route, that alternative route instantly becomes the worst decision you could ever make.  It literally becomes a complete standstill of epic proportions. And what usually happens is, after sitting in that epic movelessness (invented a word) for 20-30 minutes, at some point it will end up saying a faster route has been found, which ends up being getting back to the original route.  So lately, I'm almost at the point to now not trust these alternative route suggestions anymore, and just stick with the original route irregardless of the fact right now it's backed up due to an accident, or whatever.  Because it will undoubtedly become the better decision, anyhow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why this post?  Well, for feedback and discussion, I guess.  Just an observation.  And I guess, how can Waze &amp; Google Maps, etc, combat this?  Can they create an algorithm or program their GPS to maybe proportionately allocate alternative routes to all of its users that aren't the exact same alternative route?  Or any other ideas?

The longer the route, the more likely it is to avoid lower classed streets.  A lot of that is due to efficiency reasons.

Case in point: I take a long drive from a rural area back to my city. In the rural area there is not much traffic anyway; close to home I know the roads well and really don't need Waze's help much if at all.  BUT, right in the middle of the drive I have to pass through a couple of cities with notoriously clogged freeways. This is exactly what I want Waze to help me avoid - *the exact one thing that is most important*. And in fact I have tried to force Waze to offer alternate routes through this area, but it refused; even as I deliberately went a back route, it just kept trying to get me back to the stop-and-go mess on the freeway. I guess this is why? But if so, this seems like terrible reasoning. \n\nI mean, I understand not sending drivers through small residential streets, but there are a lot of middle-ranked roads. Waze isn't supposed to be just a GPS telling you how to get from A to B; it is supposed to help us find the best, *fastest* route.

Flash forward to today, the ETA time it shows them is exactally the time they get the notification. [Here is what I\u2019m talking about.](https://i.imgur.com/lwdBFwD.jpg) I opened this notification right after it was sent. She is at least 30 min away with good traffic. It DEFINITELY doesn\u2019t show a live map anymore with the tracking of the trip. Sometimes it just crashes when I open it. Waze has been alerting me to police or hazards literally 5-6 minutes after I passed them on the map. Sometimes it will log me out of my Waze account. No problem, I\u2019ll just sign back in. Nuh-uh! I\u2019ll reject your password and username until you reset it, even though I have all my passwords written down and organized. Only this one and Chipotle app have this problem. I mean, the navigation choices and accuracy of the map have always been a little rough, but recently it has been making huge mistakes. Sending me down one way streets it never sent me down before, horribly over or underestimating my arrival time, crashing out when any audio app is playing including Spotify. Sometimes it will crash out the audio apps and then I have to close out of Spotify/podcast app completely and restart to get audio back. \n\nThese problems started happening on my 6s a year ago and they have continued to my iPhone X. I\u2019ve tried reloading iOS, Waze, all my audio apps. Still the same. It\u2019s like they have really abandoned this app. It\u2019s been getting worse across multiple iOS updates so I don\u2019t think they are just waiting for iOS 12. \n\nAny long time lurkers from here having similar experiences or know fixes?

The [top pinned subject](https://www.waze.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=657&amp;t=194444) is called \"Vote to improve Waze staff responses to suggestions\" and covers exactly the lacking communication between users and developers. \n\n&gt; Have you volunteered to be a beta tester, so you could access the various communication links reserved for them? \n\nI've followed the Waze forums on and off for years, and the last time I checked, the beta program was closed and didn't take new people. Has that changed? Where can I find information about joining? Are the available communication channels actually allow communication with the developers? Why are those channels not available to anyone? This is not about me as an individual wanting to communicate, I'm criticizing the lack of communication as a whole.\n\n&gt; If you have problems, do not merely complain ... try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. \n\nHow is complaining \"part of the problem\"?

I drove with the app on daily, made map edits, and marked every car stopped along side the road, big pothole and cop. So, I'm really confused why an app that was so great is now suffering a noticeable, steep decline in function and quality.\n\nTell me if I'm off base here or if I'm the only person experiencing these issues:\n\nDrive sharing: You can still share a destination with \"friends\" but they no longer see your live location and an accurate ETA.  My only regular Waze friend is my wife, and we use it know who will get home from work first (and take out the dog).  I used to know exactly where on her route she was and when she'd be home to the minute.  Now, I'll receive a notification that she's on her way home or to a store or whatever, but when I click on her in my friends menu it just gives her destination- the map doesn't show her live location anymore and the ETA is wrong- the ETA always shows the current time.  She could be driving an hour to work, and I know she's still a half hour away and the ETA will say the current time.  \n\nRouting around traffic: I usually take the interstate to and from work everyday, but there is an alternate route using a parallel rural US highway that would usually be about an extra 5 to 10 minutes longer.  I cannot count how many days this year I turned on Waze in my parking lot at work, it sent me home via the Interstate, and then a couple minutes later I found myself stuck in construction.  If I had only known about the construction and slowdown, I would have taken the US highway and been home way faster.  Waze apparently didn't catch that.\n\n There are a couple other issues too that I won't harp on, but it's just frustrating that something I used every day doesn't work as well as it did four years ago.  Am I the only one?  I'm on Android and my wife is an Apple person and has the same issues.  \n\nIs there another app out there with the same features but actually functions?

The reports I have leaving my work are very inaccurate, and they are not accurate until I am closer to the juncture to where I have to decide.

Yes, *if* it knows about them *and* there's an alternative route it's also aware of which looks to be a better choice at the time.\n\nBear in mind that, unlike Google Maps navigation which is being fed with realtime traffic data from pretty much everyone in the area with an active Android phone, even if they're not using it for navigation, Waze gets data only from people actively using Waze.  \n\nIf you're in an area with a high concentration of users, the realtime traffic data will then be on a par with Google's data, and  Waze's ability to route around traffic will seem like magic.  In areas with fewer users however, it can often seem like Waze is the dumbest navigator on the planet and will quite happily let you join the end of a lengthy traffic jam it simply wasn't aware of.\n\nIt may also look like it's not working if, despite showing the traffic jam onscreen, it still routes you into the back of it rather than taking you on a different route.  Usually when this happens, it's either because the alternate route really is slower even without any traffic, or is also clogged up with traffic that Waze knows about but just hasn't shown on screen yet, and so sitting through the jam will then still get you to your destination faster than going another route even though it might not feel like it at the time...  \n\nOne thing Waze doesn't however seem to to very well is to try and predict any further build up of traffic due to the jam it already knows about - e.g. if there's been an accident up ahead, this might currently only be adding a 5 minute delay at the point you join the back of the queue, but then 5 minutes later you're still stuck in the queue having not yet reached the point of the accident, because now the emergency services have arrived and closed off another lane to start recovery, or because the traffic ahead of you has just slowed down even more due to idiots rubbernecking instead of paying attention to the road ahead.  So there are times when it knows full well about what the current delay is for drivers who've just passed through the area, but where the actual delay to you as you just join onto the back of the queue can be considerably higher.\n\nBut then there are times when it all works out better than predicted, because you've joined the queue just as it starts to clear again, so the estimated delay is considerably longer than your actual journey time...  So in my experience, the more you use Waze and place your trust in its routing decisions, the more likely you are to end up saving time overall.", "author": "twister-uk", "score": 5, "created": "2018-10-5", "permalink": "/r/waze/comments/9lj9kx/newbie_question_does_waze_try_to_route_or_reroute/e77he1i/", "parent_id": "t3_9lj9kx"}]}, {"subreddit": "waze", "sub_id": "9llr9d", "title": "Points update?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/waze/comments/9llr9d/points_update/", "author": "doso13", "score": 1, "created": "2018-10-5", "numComms": 11, "permalink": "/r/waze/comments/9llr9d/points_update/", "flair": "NaN", "selftext": "Hello.

Specifically, Waze will show me driving *away* from my destination rather than towards it, make an audible chime, then rotate 180 degrees, then show me driving *towards* my destination. When this occurs, relying on Waze for turn-by-turn directions (as I was doing while driving in an unfamiliar area last week), is rendered useless.\n\nIn addition, the speed on Waze's speedometer will radically change every second; e,g., 55, 42, 73, 51, etc.\n\nThen the issue will go away and all is well.\n\nThis is on an iPhone Xs Max, running iOS 12.0.1. By coincidence, I swapped the phone for a different color last week yet experienced the same issue on that phone, too!\n\nWhen the issue happened yesterday, I lauched Google Maps and saw the same issue there. I rarely use Apple Maps but quickly launched it and did *not* see the issue there.\n\nHas anyone else been experiencing this?", "comments": [{"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "e7o4kwd", "body": "That sounds like a problem with your phone's GPS unit,  not waze.

After the event, you could also just submit a report via the app from wherever you are at the time, although you'd then need to be prepared to add a comment to explain whereabouts the problem actually was (reports are always geolocated at your current GPS position, no matter which part of the map you may be looking at in the app at the time).  You could also report it via the most appropriate regional sub-forum on waze.com, or as a last resort just post here describing exactly where the problem was and eventually it should get back to someone able to deal with it.\n\nWhilst it's also true that some users do have genuine problems with how the app or routing servers behave, this honestly isn't how Waze continues to behave for the majority of users, which is why there are so many of us more than happy to jump to Waze's defence whenever people bring up problems like this.  I'd be amazed if any of us were Waze employees, and other than the occasional t-shirt and other goodies handed out at the annual editor conferences we certainly don't get paid for supporting Waze, so accusations of being shills isn't going to go down too well.

When you see multiple report markers in close proximity, this suggests they're being made by users on different roads (e.g. clusters of reports around a junction, over/underpass etc) or the other side of a divided road, such that their reports are being associated with a different road segment in the map data and not therefore combined with the reports nearby on other segments.\n\nFor the reporting option not to be present at all usually means that the app has either not initialised itself properly, or that those types of reports have now been blocked in the area you're travelling.\n\nOTOH, if the app is still letting you submit reports and they're genuinely not showing up on the map at all (as opposed to being combined with another report a bit further away as noted above, which can make it sometimes appear that your report hasn't been accepted) then it's probably just a random glitch with your app and/or the servers.\n\nOTotherOH, Waze can also implement user-specific blocks on making certain types of report if that user has been flagged for some reason.  As far as I know, when this happens you should receive an email to your registered Waze email (or possibly a message in your app inbox - I'm not 100% on the method of notification, just that one does exist) letting you know about the block and giving some instructions on how to go about getting it removed.", "author": "twister-uk", "score": 1, "created": "2018-11-21", "permalink": "/r/waze/comments/9ysi2m/waze_not_marking_police_traps/ea4r9n9/", "parent_id": "t1_ea3okiv"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "eaa3vox", "body": "Works fine for me ", "author": "Powderbones", "score": 1, "created": "2018-11-23", "permalink": "/r/waze/comments/9ysi2m/waze_not_marking_police_traps/eaa3vox/", "parent_id": "t3_9ysi2m"}, {"subreddit": ["waze", "GoogleMaps", "applemaps"], "comm_id": "eaf7j6y", "body": "I know how waze works.

Secondary (but probably related) that planned drives are not being populated from calendar.\n\n**Troubleshooting**: Calendars are selected, all relevant permissions granted to Waze. Waze recognizing addresses. Will receive occasional notification if Waze had recently been opened.\n\n**Possible Cause**: Google's new adaptive battery, but more specifically, the bucket system it employs ([read more here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power)). \n\n**Possible Solution**: Manually assign Waze app to \"Active\" bucket. \n\n1. Follow these instructions [https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/](https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/)\n2. Go to the Waze app and select Active\n\n**Phone Details:** Verizon Pixel 3, 128 gb, December update of Android 9\n\n**Narrative:**\n\nI have found adaptive battery to be beneficial (or at least not harmful) in maintaining my battery life, so I didn't necessary want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. But, I believe this to be a proximal cause of the Waze issue. In a little Saturday morning internet researching, I stumbled across the bucket system for adaptive battery ([link again here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power)). So the way I interpret Adaptive Battery is that based on the user's interaction with various applications (and, perhaps importantly, notifications), the system will assign apps into various buckets, ranging from \"this person never really uses this so keep it in check\", to, \"this person uses this all the time, don't mess with it\". \n\nFor me, I don't use Waze for navigation or anything else other then it's feature of telling me when I should leave before an event to get there on time. That is one of the crown jewels for my metric of a personal assistant. However, my use of Waze may be causing resources to be managed such that I don't receive those occasional notifications I desire. \n\nSo, to cut to the chase, I manually assigned Waze into the \"Active\" bucket so that adaptive battery would be nicer to it. And so far, it is working like a charm (for the last 3+ days). Now, please note: **Google does not consider what I have done as a \"Best Practice\"**, because I am not allowing the algorithm to do it's thing. And perhaps there are unintended consequences from what I've done. But I think that a tool is supposed to be helpful, otherwise it's a waste of time. \n\n[These very nice instructions](https://beebom.com/standy-apps-android-p/) will guide you through the process.
