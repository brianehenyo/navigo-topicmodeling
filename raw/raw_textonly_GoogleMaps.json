In others it\u2019s not a crime until the cops get involved and issue someone a trespass warning which can be hard to achieve since it\u2019s typically not legal for a property owner to detain someone while waiting for the cops to arrive in the absence of another crime (although this too can vary by location). For instance, if I catch you shoplifting in my store I can detain you while I call the cops and also have them issue you a trespassing warning but if I just decide I don\u2019t want you in my store for some non-criminal reason I can\u2019t lock you in an office until the cops show up. \n\nSo, while FedEx has every right to ask the Google driver to leave their property and have that right enforced by the police, if necessary, it\u2019s likely the driver wasn\u2019t actually committing a crime wherever this picture was taken.

        "body": "Hi folks, \n\nI apologise in advance for the somewhat lengthy post, but I have a few questions related to Google Earth and I was hoping you might have the answers.\n\nI travel a fair bit and I started creating maps for all the places I've been, as well as planning future trips. However, I arrived at a point where I find that My Maps is limited for my uses and I started looking at alternatives.\n\nLet me start by pointing out what I like about Maps:\n\n* Easy to use. I can search for a destination, select it, play with the icon and save it. The menus are fast and I don't have to go through endless windows to set up what I like (Something that seems to be rather tedious on Earth from my brief experience)\n* The icons are great. Sure, I wish that their library would be larger, but since all of them have a grey background and a white icon, I can create my own custom colour codes for icons that are in the same group. *The background colour changes, but the white design doesn't. It's brilliant.*\n\nAnd here comes the not so great points:\n\n* I can't have more than 10 layers. This means I have to group places from an entire continent instead of a trip/country. The list of entries in one layer can get big quickly (I don't know what the limit of markers per layer is, but I'd imagine I could reach it). I don't want to create one map for each trip, I want everything centralised.\n* No way to sort entries alphabetically. \n* No way to multi-select and edit markers. Doing 2000 markers one at a time is incredibly tedious, I can't believe that no one thought of implementing such a feature.\n* No way of transferring multiple markers from one layer to another via drag and drop, it has to be done individually (or through KML edits, but that be tedious as well if markers are not one after another)\n* No way of importing a custom icon library in one go, it has to be done icon by icon.\n\nNow, from my brief exposure to Google Earth, this is what I gathered:\n\n* It supports a lot more layers in the form of folders. I'm slightly annoyed that whenever I make a new folder, it always ends up at the bottom and I can't seem able to create a folder within a folder, even though I can drag &amp; drop it thereafter creation without a problem. In the grand scheme of things, it's not that bad.\n* Earth has a lot more info related to locations. I can also include photos, descriptions etc. of every marker I place. That's great as I can link my photos to the map.\n* I can import my map from My Maps and the icons and the colour scheme come through, however, they've not added to the library automatically. I'm yet to find a way where I can export the default Maps icons and use them on Earth (is this even possible?)\n* I wanted to import a custom icon pack from MapIcons. Firstly, I can only add one icon at a time, just like in Maps. Secondly, the colour I choose is applied to the entire Icon, even the white design which I want to remain white.\n* While Earth has more functionalities, the menus are designed like something from the 2000s. Endless clicking through tabs and pop-up windows. It's inefficient in my eyes when you want to edit thousands of entries.\n* No multi-select for drag &amp; drop from one folder to another. To me, having to modify the KML file to recreate the folder structure I want to have in Earth and move markers around is 100% not the way things should be done. Especially when the markers are not necessarily already sorted country, it'll be hard to scan the entire file and figure out which marker needs to go where without the visual aid of the map alongside.\n* No multi-edit of similar markers.\n\nI can live with some of the issues in GE, but having icons that behave just like in Maps (only the background colour changes, the white design stays white) and marker relocating are important to me. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nCheers,\n"

From the [Google Help Article](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838):\n\n*If your Internet connection is slow or absent, Google Maps will use your offline maps to give you directions.*\n\nThis most likely implies that if your internet connection is present and not-slow, then it **will** be used.\n\nOn the other hand, if you intentionally put your phone in airplane mode (i.e. not normal use), then it will save on cell data. In that case, *some* battery will likely be saved, since your cell radio won't be in operation. But during active navigation, screen display and GPS sensor are what use most of the battery, so the savings might be unnoticeable."

However if the visitor is arriving from the east, Google Maps wrongly gives directions to turn into a completely different neighborhood and then assumes they can just hop over a canal to get to our house, because from the east that might be slightly closer, as-the-crow-flies.\n\nI think the main issue here is that for some reason Google Maps navigation algorithm is either ignoring the huge group of lakes/canals that border our home, or is wrongly assuming that it can be crossed with a vehicle.\n\nThis has turned into a major quality of life issue for us!  We cannot order pizza, can't get picked up by Uber, and every time someone comes to visit us we have to factor in an extra hour for them to drive around lost trying to find us!  It is really quite incredible in this day and age that no matter how clearly we try to give visitors explicit instructions to ignore their GPS and follow our careful verbal instructions, THEY STILL ignore us and follow their GPS and get lost!\n\nI have made several minor edits and corrections to Google Maps over the years and they have always been quickly acknowledged and accepted.  I have sent \"corrections\" to Google three times for this problem and they have all been completely ignored.  I think the trouble there is that my address is actually completely correct and the location of my street and house on their maps are totally right ... it's just that the directions to get here are often wrong!\n\nWhat can I do?

When you try to find this place afterwards into this particular category, it's main title is an address or even worse it's map coordinates! You have to tap and open the place to display the label which of course is almost impossible if you have a big list. The only way to scroll items viewing your labels is under \"labeled\" category which is huge and not categorized and contact addresses are also in there (if you want) making it a real mess.\nI am really curious why people do not bombard google with feedback about this super annoying issue and why google after so many years did nothing about this.

However, that's a far busier line so I prefer to commute via the slightly \"slower\" route as it means I'm guaranteed to get a seat most days and it's literally only 2 minutes slower (it's not even guaranteed I'll get on the train at all with the other route at rush hour, which obviously negates any speed advantages).\n\nI, in theory, like the Google Now/Maps feature in Android which gives me a notification with train times/delays etc, but is there a way to force it to use a route which isn't a recommended one (There's a few options shown, including a couple of variations of the train I don't get (basically the same route but then getting either the Tube or a bus at the other end rather than a ten minute walk) but not the actual train I want to get)?"

Right now, I have them laid out in a document with all the points in their own folder and all the polygons in their own folder.\n\nWhat would be neat is if I could also choose to select a point-polygon pair (or multiple such pairs) directly and make only those chosen visible without having to pick them out manually from their segregated folders.\n\nBasically, it'd be like being able to select rows in a table as well as being able to select columns.  The table below may help in visualizing what I mean.\n\n| |Point|Polygon|\n|-|-|-|\n|**Pair 1**|x1,y1|Triangle1|\n|**Pair 2**|x2,y2|Square2|\n|**Pair 3**|x3,y3|Triangle3|\n|**Pair 4**|x4,y4|Hexagon4|\n|**Pair 5**|x5,y5|Rectangle5|\n\nRight now, I can choose to turn on the points, the polygons, both, or neither (or select specific ones by opening the folders).  That'd be like selecting based on columns in this table.  I'd like to be able to control the visibility of points and their polygons from another list of checkboxes that each control a row in the table, selecting or deselecting a point and its associated polygon together.\n\nIs there some way to do that in the KML format?\n\nMaybe some way of abusing `NetworkLink`s to pull stuff from another part of the same KML document?\n\n...Okay, so, maybe you can pull this off by just abusing radio buttons, having the polygons and points in there twice, and using a creative folder structure, but that's pretty wasteful when the polygons have a lot of vertices."

Nodes are points along the road where the road segment can change direction, allowing curves.  The normally would be in order, if we numbered them we'd see node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, etc.  What's happened here is that at least one node got pulled backwards to create node 1, node 2, node 4, node 3, node 5, etc.\n\nSince this is something anyone can see on the map and it doesn't require local knowledge to confirm I've submitted an error report for you as below.\n\nThe text I used was \"Nodes on the road are out of order, making the directions tell a user to U-turn at this point.  The nodes need to be straightened out so there is no step mentioned at all at this point.\"  This should get it resolved.\n\nYou can submit such reports at any time.

Here is a copy/paste.\n\n\"Denali Park road, **vehicles are only allowed on it 3 days a year at the very end of the season (why it\u2019s snowing) and you have to win an online lottery to get a permit to drive it.** There are a million rules, one of them being you can\u2019t approach animals with vehicles which is why everyone is giving him such a wide space.\n\nI\u2019ve done the drive a couple times and it\u2019s always amazing.\"\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nWhen you go to it on [Google Earth,] (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Denali+Park+Rd,+Denali+National+Park+and+Preserve,+AK+99755/@63.7215116,-149.0056053,13.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x56ccdf524e1b873f:0x96f27455e4073570!8m2!3d63.7341606!4d-148.9120552) there is no Street View.\n\nAs this is such an amazing road and it is only open three days each year, I would hope the Street View Team could make it a priority to get up there and drive it.  \n\nLove to get this message to the powers that be.  Any help with this would be appreciated.  Thanks!"

Fast forward to coming in tonight and the fact that my background image on my laptop was this screensaver was coincidece enough for me to be a little bit weirded out. To say the least"

Clicking through it brings me off to weird roads I didn't try to click on sometimes, and the keyboard works fine but the blurring of the photo loading throws off the feeling that I'm actually driving.

I've been using the Street View app on a Galaxy S8+ to submit them so far but purchased a Samsung Gear 360 earlier this week so I could try some more involved projects. As a test, I went to a nearby all-season trail on the 24th and with a tripod folded up in my backpack, tested the interval mode so it would take a shot every few seconds. I walked the 20 minute loop and submitted all the shots when I got home. All photos were available in the correct place shortly after and I was showing them to a few people, when I checked later in the day - most were gone. I went back to the Street View app and clicked on a few random ones and they all say \"Maps Rejected\". There are only a few left visible to the public and they are no different so I assume these will vanish too. \n\nCoincidentally, the 2 that I submitted many months ago using just my phone are still there - one was even a quick submit and isn't even a full sphere. With nearly all the new stuff gone, this trip feels like a complete waste.

I know where I live the town itself has different addys for apartments and Google uses town data sometimes for their addys so the info is incorrect on Google maps. \n\nIn your house registration does it have a some sort of geographical info on it that you can send to Google to show both address and geo location?

He sent me the confirmation document when he finished getting it registered. It had a satellite photo of the property with the address and the adjoining addresses and properties clearly defined. Several people were copied on the email, including people with the local telephone company, the 911 address management service people, several people in the county clerk's office, people with att, and people with the Post Office. To confirm, I went to the post office and had them look it up in their database as if they were going to ship a package there, and they confirmed it now exists. \n\n3) The confirmation document I received includes an older satellite photo of the property (though the new parking lot next door is not yet there), with addresses and property lines defined. It also has a long parcel ID number included.\n\n4) I have searched around for such a spot for sending Google more information with attachments but have been unsuccessful.

For years, Google Maps has shown the street names in both Traditional Chinese characters and in pinyin (which is Mandarin written out using the roman alphabet). \n\n In a recent update, Google has removed nearly all of the pinyin, which means that unless you can read Traditional characters, you're shit out of luck when it comes to navigating around.  It's completely frustrating, considering that **the physical street signs here have both Traditional characters and pinyin.**  \n\nI have no idea why Google thought it was a good idea to remove pinyin, when having both was literally the best case scenario- AND THEY HAD BOTH DISPLAYED FOR YEARS.

I've managed to set up a Google spreadsheet with two columns, \"Location\" and \"Note\". I update my map layer, taking the location from the location column and using the note column as the designation for the colour code.\n\nI can make this work for multiple points and designations, but I can't seem to make the points on the map update automatically when I update the spreadsheet and I was wondering if anyone here might have some ideas?\n\nI can make it update by deleting the layer and re-syncing it with the spreadsheet so it shows the new locations/designations, but I can't make it automatically update which is what I was hoping to use the map for.\n\nAny info or advice would be really helpful, \n\nThanks,\n\nPip"

Anyone know why this is... did Maps ever use WebP? They use vectored data for basemap and 3D imagery so this would only apply to Streetview and 2D Satellite\n\nI done a few small tests where I pulled down the 90 or so JPEG image tiles used to make up a 360o Streetview \"scene\" and batch converted them to WebP using Irfanview. The combined JPEG images ranged from 1.5MB for countryside / non-busy scenes to 2.5MB for city-centre / busy scenes. There were substantial savings made converting these JPEG image tiles to WebP - ranging from 30 - 45% - and without any noticeable degradation in image quality. I'm sure Google could do much better too than my lazy Irfanview batch convert effort... their adaptive image compression AI would achieve some impressive data savings across the entire Streetview / 2D Satellite catalogue I'd imagine"

On top of that, the format would have to be added into the data processing pipeline, and the entire tileset would have to be regenerated in webp format."

I thought WebP had better browser support than that :(  ... but then Chrome is reported to have near 60% share of the global browser market so there's almost justification to offer WebP tiles based on Chrome's usage alone!\n\nI realise the requirement to re-encode and store the entire tilesets in a second format just to offer WebP and while the storage requirements for Streetview and 2D Satellite would already be massive... likely many Petabytes... in the scheme of things at Google, it isn't massive and adding WebP tiles alongside wouldn't break them. I'd guess that YouTube storage alone dwarfs Maps times over, while some of their compute customers and products like Photos and Drive are probably closing in.\n\nPerhaps Google has already run the numbers and realised there was little benefit delivering WebP for the remaining imagery tiles. While those like myself on slow connections would benefit somewhat, I can't imagine it would bring any significant savings to Google's bandwidth bill (do they even pay for bandwidth anymore?!) and as above, it would just add to their storage requirements. Seeing as the basemap and 3D imagery is delivered as some sort of vector data... perhaps this is in the plan for SV?"

Here is a translated description of it.\n\n&gt; The shape of Jingsitai is composed of two arc-shaped curved walls that are close to each other and rise spirally, symbolizing the gradual and peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The center is a circular platform with 912 copper studs inlaid in the marble. The 912 soldiers who gave their lives during the battle and the bronze nails constitute the symbol of the motherland symbolize peaceful reunification. A striking red pin points out the location of the Yijiangshan Island; there are 34 memorial stone rings distributed around the country, which means the country's 34 A complete family consisting of provinces and cities, each stone seat engraved with the abbreviation of each province, the golden word represents the soldiers from the province among the participants, while the gray is the opposite; the arched walls and the round platform constitute The word \"9\" means \"to be one in ninety-nine and pray for Datong.\"\n\nHere is a site with a close up view of it: http://www.576tv.com/Program/319320.html\n"

For some reason, it is using an absolutely abnormal amount of data lately. \n\nHere's some things to note:\n\n-I have an offline map downloaded that covers essentially all of NJ and the parts of PA I travel in (do I need to have data turned off to use this?)\n\n-In the data usage settings of my android phone, I have \"Allow background data usage\" turned off\n\n-I used google maps through google android in my car's monitor 90% of the time that I use maps.\n\nSo just an example of how much it's using, I went to a happy hour for work. Got in my car, plugged in my phone, maps comes up on my car's dash. The \"Home\" navigation is already right there so I click it and start my journey. No more than 10-15 minutes into my drive I get a notification that I am out of data (I have 2 gigs total). \n\nWhen I got home I checked the usage. I used about 0.5 gigs within that short drive (again I have a map downloaded for this area and background data turned off). The data usage for that trip was about .02 GB of foreground data and .47 GB of background data. Why is it using background data when I have that setting turned off???\n\nLike I said, this never happened until about 2 months ago. I would use maps all the time in the same fashion and never have any issue. \n\nSo what is going on here? Is it android auto? Should I turn off my data anytime I'm driving so it uses offline maps?"

Google maps seem to now translate all labels into the one language you choose in your settings. My Google language is Czech and this makes many local names look completely silly. In addition, it's harder for me to find the places I need because I'm used to using names in their native languages (I.e. it takes me some time to realize '\u0160t\u00fdrsk\u00fd Hradec' is actually Graz or that 'Elb\u00ednek' is Elblag).\n\nI could switch to English, but that just changes the flavor of the problem.

Please take a few minutes to review the announcement to familiarize yourself with the upcoming changes.\n\nWe would like to highlight a few updates that may impact your implementation. Beginning June 11th, we are launching our new pricing plan and providing all users access to support. We\u2019ll continue to offer a free tier \u2014 all developers will receive $200 of free monthly usage of our core products.\n\nIn addition, this change will require you to enable billing and associate it with all of your Google Maps Platform projects. Creating a billing account helps us better understand your usage so we can continue developing helpful products. It also allows you to scale easily with less downtime and fewer performance issues if your product grows beyond the $200 of free monthly usage. For additional visibility and control you can set daily quotas or billing alerts.\n\nHow does this affect your current projects?\n\nProject: My Project (1111111)\n\n**Based on your current usage over the last 3 months and our new pricing plan, we estimate that your cost will exceed the current $200 free tier.**\n\nAs an incentive, we are offering you a one time promotional coupon of $200.00. To activate this coupon, you must enable billing and load this coupon to your account before June 11th.\n\nWe want to support you along the way. Please read our Guide for Existing Users to understand how these changes may impact your account and what steps you need to take.\n\nThank you for using Google Maps Platform."

Not just selected tourist attractions, but *everything*.  This is going to be of tremendous interest 50-100 years from now.\n\nHowever a big problem is that it's subject at any time to being removed and deleted.  Panoramio, for example, was an amazing collection of georeferenced images, and would have been of tremendous interest to future historians, but of course Google decided to basically delete it from existence.  Someone I think needed to be involved with creating a liaison between the Library of Congress or the National Archives in order to preserve all this information.  Now it needs to be done with Street View before everything is upgraded and the old data is removed.  I haven't heard of any sort of initiative to do this.\n\nAlso all the blurred people, randomly blurred objects, and so forth are a huge problem for any sort of archival effort.  I guess that's beside the point, but 100 years from now, the people captured in the photographs will be of as much interest as the places.  Future genealogists and descendants have a chance of seeing bits of their ancestors and family outside the Street View photos of their houses.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are efforts underway to preserve all these images?"

Keeping data in a server for 100+ years 1) I don't even know if it's technically possible, 2) the expense would be quite a lot. \n\nAlso, your point about the blurred faces and objects raises an interesting question.

The only other information provided is their phone number and a web address.\n\nI looked into it further, and this business is an \"independent distributor\" for an international cosmetics company, SeneGence International. Since this distributor appears to be in Google maps purely as an advert and not providing any real, useful map-related information, I reported the listing as spam. My report was denied as being unverified.\n\nAm I wrong to think that this is spam? I don't really care what they're selling as long as it's legal, but my feeling with Google maps is that it ought to be a useful resource for finding locations, people, and business around you. I don't see how using it as a free advertising platform for what is essentially an online-only presence fits this mission.

If a road normally has a certain amount of traffic at a particular time of day, and then the amount drops to zero, Google should theoretically be able to realise that there is at least a chance that the road is closed. However, after multiple recent incidents of being directed towards a closed road, I've realised that this is not a feature \u2013 or if it is, it's not working very well in this case. At the very least, I would have hoped that there was some way of the council (or highways agency, or whoever is relevant) telling Google about road closures \u2013 or Google picking up the publicly available closure data (these are scheduled closures)."

Google Maps Satellite view uses different sets of imagery for different zoom levels. For example, [look at this farmland in Nebraska](https://goo.gl/maps/jMzZYg4EB7U2) and zoom in one level\u2014it\u2019s pretty obvious these are two sets of images captured at different times.\n\nSo it seems Google Maps has close-up imagery for the Serrana Bank area, but for whatever reason it isn\u2019t properly integrated with the more zoomed-out imagery, resulting in the black splotches.\n\nA semi-related Google Maps quirk (https://goo.gl/maps/3as8hPWvZ3n) is the island of Roncador Cay in the [Roncador Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roncador_Bank). What\u2019s strange about that one is that it\u2019s blacked out at **all** zoom levels.

By minimal I mean the listed towns and the major roads between them. Since they actually listed regions and not towns, maybe they'll cover more (I hope so). But looking at the coverage for Ghana, Senegal and Tunisia I'm not sure they will cover a lot of things.\n\nAs you can see it will probably miss a big part of the country (which is emptier, and probably security concerns near Somalia and South Sudan). I think we can also expect some trails in Mount Kenya NP since they covered towns around it.\n\nFor interested people, the data I found is [HERE](https://www.google.com/intl/ALL_ALL/streetview/feed/driving/data.json).\n\nThis is the file that list all locations (past, present and few future) where Google sends cars. You can find interesting things there, like India (which was planned, but Indian government blocked the publication of pictures) or new Austria coverage.

Those two substrings are:\n\n1530709200  \nand  \n1530712800\n\nThey differ by 3600, which by no coincidence is the number of seconds in an hour (the amount we changed our arrival time by). Interestingly though these appear to be UTC seconds, not localized ones. I can't explain that, nor can I guarantee anything about this approach."

Thank you in advance"
    },
    {
        "id": "e12iisy",
        "body": "As I see it, the steps to accomplish this task are basically:\n\n1. Find the latitude/longitude for the given address, i.e. **geocode** the address.\n2. Use those coordinates to calculate the latitude/longitude of the location 138 miles due north.\n    * The longitude should be the same since we're not moving west or east at all.\n    * According to Wikipedia, [a difference of one degree latitude \u2248 111km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_latitude). (Technically, it varies a tiny bit depending on how far away you are from the equator, but fortunately the question says \u201croughly\u201d.) Doubling that, 222 km (138 mi) correponds to a two-degree difference in latitude, we simply add 2 to the latitude we got from the last step. What a convenient distance!\n3. Take the latitude/longitude from the previous step and use **reverse geocoding** to find the closest address to that point.\n\nSo using the example address from the question:\n\n**1** By sending the API request `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1398+N+Sanford Rd,+Afton,+NY+13730&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY`, we geocode the address to get the coordinates. All we really care about is the `geometry`/`location` portion of the response:\n\n    \u2026\n    \"geometry\": {\n        \"location\": {\n            \"lat\": 42.1792879,\n            \"lng\": -75.4277321\n         },\n    \u2026\n\n**2** The latitude of the location 138 miles north of that address is 42.1792879 + 2 = **44.1792879**. The longitude is the same. So the latitude/longitude we\u2019ll need to reverse geoencode is `44.1792879,-75.4277321`.\n\n**3** Now, using the reverse geocoding API, we send this request: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=44.1792879,-75.4277321&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY`. The response gives a bunch of different `results`. Each one is a different way to describe the address\u2014some specific, some less so. Each item in the `results` array includes an item called `formatted_address`, which is basically the one-line summary. Here are the `formatted_address` results we get in response to that API request:\n\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Fusa Blvd, Gouverneur, NY 13642, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Diana, NY, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Gouverneur, NY 13642, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"Lewis County, NY, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"New York, USA\"\n    \"formatted_address\": \"United States\"\n\nEven though we got a street name, we didn\u2019t get an actual address. But Google Maps itself [doesn\u2019t give address numbers for that section of Fusa Boulevard](https://goo.gl/maps/7dN3Sk58oxy), so it\u2019s not really the API\u2019s fault."

Although not a huge deal, i have to give \"alternative\" directions to pizza delivery drivers and in some apps I can't verify my address because they use Google Maps.\n\nIs there a way to \"expedite\" this? i am pretty surprised it's been 4 years and still not added."

Looking on the map it seemed interesting and was through an area I wasn't familiar with.  So off I went...\n \nAt the very first place that I was to leave paved city roads and get onto a bike path, there was a big sign prohibiting bicycles!!!!  The sign showed that bicycles should be walked and not ridden in that area.  But now that I was already there and quite far from the route I would take regularly (mostly surface streets) I decided to try anyway.  I rode onto the path and kept going... keeping my eyes open for officials.\n \nAfter a few kilometers I was back on quiet residential streets and I was thinking this was pretty cool (other for the part where I wasn't supposed to be riding).\n \nNext I was on a small gravel road (I've got a mountain bike so that's okay) for about a kilometer and then came up to a locked gate blocking my access.  I double checked the Google directions and indeed it had me going through there.  I could see the nice gravel road/path continuing past the gate and I saw it was possible to walk through the bush on one side and get around the gate so I did that.  I continued on, for about 2 km when I came to ANOTHER locked gate blocking my exit from that area.  And there was no way to climb that gate or go around it.  At this point I was pretty mad at Google Maps for getting me there.  I would have to backtrack all the way and find another way in an area I wasn't familiar with.  As I turned around and started back I noticed a faint trace of path through the woods and bush.  I walked the bike through that (and there was LOTS Of POISON IVY!!!!!!!) carefully and then got back on a paved road that was part of an access or service road to a highway (Hwy 13, south of Gouin) with very heavy and very fast traffic!  Not a bike-friendly section at all!! \n \nAnyway, not seeing much other option, I continued on and eventually (less than one km) came to a more proper gravel bike path.  And made it home intact.\n \nBut I see no way to report these errors to Google Maps.  The \"bike\" routing was completely wrong in this case and it would be nice to help keep other riders from venturing there thinking that Google must be right.\n \nAny way to report this to Google Map people?\n"

As long as you have a view of the sky GPS will work perfectly anyway. \nWhen an Android phone in high accuracy mode fetches its location, the order is usually least accurate to most accurate. \n\nSo first it fetches a triangulation from cellular towers and this provides a broad general area, like a neighbourhood. Then Bluetooth and WiFi, both these technologies transmit data that can be used for location without needing to actually be \"connected\" to them, and that narrows location down to say about 10-20m accuracy.\nThen GPS information is usually available as GPS takes the longest to lock on, this brings accuracy down to a few meters. If there is a data connection then a feature called AGPS can be used to speed up GPS lock but it's not essential.\n\nWhen you are indoors location comes from everything besides GPS.\n\n[Here's an article](https://www.androidpolice.com/2015/05/29/android-m-feature-spotlight-bluetooth-scanning-joins-wifi-to-improve-location-accuracy/) from way back when Bluetooth scanning was added and it's only gotten better since then.\n\n"

On their website they have this explanation:\n\n&gt;A plus code is like a street address for people or places that don't have one.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plus codes give addresses to everyone, everywhere, allowing them to receive deliveries, access emergency services, register to vote \u2013 and more.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A plus code address looks like a regular address, but with a short code where the street name and number would be. These addresses exist for any location, even for places where there are no roads.\n\nI am glad Google  maps is getting a way to share a location without Longitude and latitude but there is a much better way than plus codes!\n\nI think Google Should have used [What3Words](https://what3words.com/) instead its much more simple than these plus codes they incorporated.  Instead of a \"code\" of numbers and letters, What3Words uses 3 words that can be used to easily share an exact location and the 3 word address i my opinion is a lot easier to share then a string of letters and numbers that do not add up to anything....\n\nHere is an example from both side by side for the same location:\n\nPlus Code: XGJ7+FX     \nWhat3Words:  works.kept.verge \n\nRant over, hopefully someone form the Google maps team checks this out...."

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1w6vch/why_is_gps_more_accurate_at_getting_my_cellphone/) an r/askscience post that explains why GPS is more accurate than cell tower triangulation, for example.

The background of this [FCC White Paper](https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/911/Apps%20Wrkshp%202015/911_Help_SMS_WhitePaper0515.pdf) also explains the strengths and weaknesses of each location system.\n\nRegardless, Google Maps isn't doing anything special - it's probably just using the built in [Android API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager) to fetch the device's location, and the Android OS is doing the heavy lifting (merging GPS data with other sources like cell triangulation, wifi SSID, [bluetooth low energy beacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy_beacon), etc."

As of a day or two ago, Google Maps has started randomly translating the names of locations and I really need this to stop.  Here is an example:\n\nIn German, Stadt means city/town, Haus is house, and Br\u00fccke is bridge.  When I open Maps and just zoom around, you can see this S Bahn (subway/metro) station called Stadthausbr\u00fccke [here.](https://i.imgur.com/s4LRusJ.png)  If I search for \"Stadthausbr\u00fccke\" though, the result I get is this weird translated name, which really has no meaning [seen here.](https://i.imgur.com/p007nai.png)\n\nThis really becomes a problem when I am trying to get directions - [for example here.](https://i.imgur.com/UOCe4qi.png)  Rough House and Maiden Walk must be some bad translation from Google Translate, which makes it super difficult, especially when in a rush.  I just want it to display the German names.\n\nAs I mentioned, this only started happening recently and it is very inconsistent as well.  It's the same on my wife's phone as of a few days ago too, so I'm guessing it was something from a recent update.  I've checked all the language settings of the phone and can't find anything related in Maps.  Any ideas are greatly appreciated!   "

Usually it says location updated 9 hours ago or something like that and if I hit refresh it does nothing even if I know the person is moving.\n\nIs there any hope of Google actually improving this? Main reason I'm asking is because I really want to make the move to android, but this function (Find My Friends on iPhone, which actually functions how Google Maps advertises theirs) is something I use consistently and it's much more convenient to just leave it on indefinitely as opposed to having to remember to always turn it on before runs/races/commuting (which is what the other cross-platform alternatives require)."

It has caused me to turn far too early on two consecutive trips and is leading me to look over at the screen for far too long as I drive which is pretty darn dangerous. \n\nIt's always scaled out at high speed and scaled back in for city driving, which is a great feature. But now it's showing me up to 15 miles at a time when I start my journey and scaling in to the point where my previous experience would have been considered high speed scale when I arrive at my destination. It's just too far away to be able to use safely, in my opinion. \n\nIs there a way to fix this? \nIs there a reason this has happened since I put my phone to factory, given that it's never been an issue before? \n\nThanks in advance for all replies.

I am better at DOS and Batch Files so I have created (just finishing off testing) a batch file that pretty much does everything I could hope for when it comes to GPX to KML conversions. For tracks it first uses trakcleaner to remove stationary spider waypoints, then GPSBabel creates the KML file (trackdata=0 discards all times - very sweet) and then I use FART (Find and Replace Text 1.99) to change track name, line colour and width. It takes about 5 seconds to convert it. I come across regex often and do need to start messing about with it. Anyway - hope you have a great weekend and thanks again. Regards"

Remember at all times that the navigation feature is all about getting you there efficiently.  So to that end, you need to add stops along your route so that instead of it being an A to B trip you make it an A to B to C to D to E trip.  Then Maps will route you the most efficient way to each of your stops, including rerouting you if the best route changes are you're travelling, so be sure to include enough stops along the route to counter rerouting.\n\nSee my screenshots to understand what I mean.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/5iQ22ut"

        "body": "When I was in school growing up, I spent many an hour exploring the world beyond where my feet could carry me via Google Maps. I remember when I first discovered street view. So enamored with it was I that nowadays I feel a tinge of nostalgia when I come across a country road whose most recent Google car snapshot was taken back in 2007. These images are grainy and often dark, but still strangely beautiful, if only for what they represented--the world, for the first time, and so much as it ever could be, at your fingertips.\n\nGoogle created one of the most astounding, vast, and deep libraries of information ever concieved when it developed street view. But Google went one step further, allowing its users to upload photographs and eventually videos and 360\u00b0 viewpoints from anywhere in the world. The process was simple yet magical: simply upload the photo and pin it to the proper location on the map, and suddenly you, little old me or you, had added a small piece to the internet's greatest library of easily accessible, geotagged photos.\n\nOne could spend hours on a rainy summer afternoon pouring over photos of obscure and nameless locales in Greenland, Southeast Asia,  some island in the middle of the ocean; or even the backwoods of your own stomping grounds. Google Maps has given all of us an incredible amount of freedom to explore, as well as a resource for research, and even a launching point for adventure.\n\nI guess this is a love letter to Google Maps, and an expose of how much it has meant to me. But also I wish to bemoan how the service has been corrupted in some small ways--most notably, with the recent shutdown of Panoramio, and the accompanying loss of innumerable photos.\n\nNot only were an immense amount of photos tossed into the recycle bin of internet history, but also in justification Google's best excuse for deleting the archive was (I paraphrase), 'protectibg the privacy of Panoramio users.' That reason is made hollow by the plainly obvious fact that none of those users actually shared Google's concern for the aforementioned privacy, as it was the users who put those photos in the public sphere to begin with. And Panoramio had so much that you won't find on Google Maps if you look today. Photos of remote, nameless places, as well as historic photographs and imagery geotagged and accessible on Maps.\n\nI will go on just a little more, as Google has committed one more sin against its own service that I would like to call out. As mentioned before, adding photos to Google Maps used to be as simple as uploading the content and pinning it on the map. But that has changed. Now, every photo has to be tied to a location already named on Google Maps. In order to upload, you type in a place, upload the photo, and there you go...a photo of said place, whether or not the photo is actually of said place or of a nearby landmark that Google does not know or care about. This severely restricts the freedom users once had in sharing photos of any place they had been to. Sure, a lot of photos are placed incorrectly by users, but that's no excuse to remove everyone's ability to precisely place a photo on the map.\n\nTL;DR\nI love Google maps, have had nothing but a wonderful time with it and have grown genuinely fond of it over the years it has blessed us with its existence. But I am sad to see Google strip away some of the best features when it comes to community sontibuted photos. Panoramio is gone and never coming back, and the new photo layer format in general is more restrictive and (some say) catering to advertisers over individual users.\n\nMost of all I am sad to see something as monumental as Panoramio go out with barely a whimper. Not so much as a poorly made tribute video on YouTube. Maybe I'll make one. Anyone got any links to archived Panoramio content?\n\nP.S.-I know that photos can still be uploaded and precisely placed on Google Earth. Thank God for that, it's all we've got left as far as that goes.\n\nP.P.S.-mad props to Google for upgrading Google Maps to a spherical format. The Mercator projection is an abomination and Maps is infinitely better for transcending it.\n\nP.P.P.S.-do you love Maps as much as I do? Tell me about it, I'd like to hear from some fellow map nuts! Lately I've been obsessing over potential bicycling routes/areas of exploration in the place I'll be moving to in a year or two, how 'bout you?"

I'm not super familiar with the comment and review system. I'm curious if it was a moderator or something,  and why would someone call up to date accurate facts misleading?\n\nAny response would be appreciated.. Thanks"

Sometimes that's all that's needed for these situations, but:\n\n* if the middle of the house is closer to 19th Street than it is to Maple, this is not the fix.\n* if the marker does need to be moved but you're moving the marker only a small distance then this won't trigger the fix \n\nIt helps to understand that the marker and the access point are two different things.  The marker is where any label will be applied and where the teardrop marker will be placed.  The access point normally is put in the same spot, but doesn't have to be.  The access point is where directions will lead.  When a large marker move is made the access point will normally follow automatically but, as mentioned, for small marker moves the access point will not be updated.   And after correctly positioning the marker in the middle of the main building should the marker be closer to one road than the actual access road; a request to Google to move the access point is the proper action over moving the marker.\n\nIn such a case you can make sure the marker is properly positioned; wait a few days for navigation to update (if you moved the marker), and then if there is still issues one should bring up directions, click to see the step-by-step directions, and then hit Send Feedback.  This will put flags by each step of the directions, one would flag the last step and then describe that the access point needs to be moved."

It could be something you need to adjust with your edit, or you could be doing it perfectly fine but Google's not understanding and an escalation is needed; but either way the only method to figure it out is to share your address.\n\nFor that reason my best advice is to post on the [Google Maps forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/maps) stating your having such an issue but would like to keep your information off the public forum.

Now if I do the same, I get a pop up saying to use the app for hands free navigation.  If I tap ok it opens the app store of all things.  I already have maps installed so I click open and it opens maps but has lost my destination.  I type in my destination again and it can't navigate because it no longer defaults to my current location as the starting point.  What used to take one click now takes well over a minute of BS.\n\nA few times recently when I've used it it has insisted I was heading in the opposite direction than I'm actually headed.  The map swings around wildly and I can't use it for directions.  I have androsensor installed and all of my sensors are working correctly so it's definitely something in the software.\n\nAll of this started before the update to Android 9 but seems to have gotten worse.  I've installed Waze and use that now but I'm pretty sad because I was loyal to maps for many years.  Is there something I can do to make it work like it did even a year ago?"

[...] They had a complex market system. While men dominated business, women ran the markets. Then, as now, shops selling similar goods would be on the same street. Today in Mexico City, businesses along a single street still specialize in one product: a street for office supplies, another for self service copies and camera equipment, another for eyewear and optical examinations, and yet another street for wedding dresses. *Calle Miguel Schultz* has funeral parlors."

I chalked it up to crappy GPS on the phone.  But when I got Strava (activity tracking app) I noticed that it was super accurate.  Even showed me milling around in circles waiting for my friend.  After having used Strava I checked Google for the same ride and Google's timeline seemed to improve at least 85 percent accuracy.    \nSo, now, does Google Maps just suck at detecting GPS data, is my phone screwing up in sending the data to Google?  Does Google maps just not think it needs to be that accurate?  Obviously my GPS is fine because Strava is dead-on.  Is this because that's pretty much all Strava does so it can be more accurate? "

You can rely on it having recorded your day if you later need to get that information.  Because you never turn it off it needs to barely use any power; it just uses your location that the phone already is checking about once a minute.\n* A GPS tracking app is something that you turn on when you want a precise track.  It's only meant to be used during the period when you want the precise track because actively seeking a GPS fix once a second is going to eat up your battery, along with further eating up your battery by recording the data that often.\n\nBoth Timeline and Stava do a fine job at what they are designed to do; the issue is that they serve different purposes."

        "body": "Hello internet,\n\nI have a theory for you. I think I've located a massive impact crater using google earth, and I think it ties in with some fringe theories, I have recently become acquainted with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt all started when I watched a youtube video a few days back, which put forth the theory that the myth of Atlantis might be based on the demise of a prehistoric civilization which inhabited the feature know as the Eye of Sahara - and the arguments put forward in the video were very compelling, as both the size, location, shape and even it's relation to north and south seems to match the description provided by Plato. If you like to entertain such ideas, I suggest you check out the video for context [The Lost City of Atlantis - Hidden in Plain Sight - Advanced Ancient Human Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDoM4BmoDQM) \\- the host of this channel puts forward a lot of ideas in other videos that I disagree with, but in relations to this subject I feel he had a lot of interesting input.  \n\n\nIn the video they share the following image, in relation to something called the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothisis. There seems to be a lot of controversy regarding this theory, and it has yet to be fully discarded or approved by the academic community. Basically there are ice core samples from multiple source around the planet which indicate that at around 12.800 years ago, and again, about 1000 years later, the world experienced two quick bursts of extreme warming and flash flooding, basically overnight, and it is suggested that this was caused by some sort of extra terrestrial impact, and as far as I can gather, everything from asteroids and meteors, to sun flares/bursts has been on the table.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/520pmm3k7fl11.jpg\n\nThis picture is also shared in other videos on the same channel, and in those the host elaborates further on its meaning. The picture is supposed to indicate that North America was impacted 12.800 years ago, and it is then explained that this caused massive flash floods which contributed to the extinction of several mega fauna, carved out the landscape and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nI don't really understand the values on this map, but my gut instinct tells me that the impact would more likely be in the Middle East, since the values there are highest, and that the values found elsewhere show the trajectory of the impact as it explodes across the northern hemisphere.\n\nSo after this thought hit me I went on to google earth and started looking for a crater. I actually did this two evenings in a row. The first evening I looked at the Sahara and I was amazed by how much it looks as though a massive wall of mud has washed across northern Africa. But no matter how much I looked I didn't seem to find any origin of these patterns.\n\nBut the next day I zoomed out a bit more, and I started looking for bigger patterns, and as I scrolled towards the Middle East and beyond I found something. \n\nJust north of Tibet there is a desert that looks like a massive crater, and if you follow it's trajectory it aligns almost perfectly with the dry and arid areas that define the landscape from the Middle East, across the Arabian Peninsula and all the way to the west coast of northern Africa. Check out the collage below, that I have stitched together with pictures from google earth.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r807hmhs4fl11.jpg\n\nJust a coincidence? Maybe. I don't know enough about any of these subject to judge for myself.\n\n  \nBut I feel like it fits well with the ideas that an impact ended the last ice age, crossed massive havoc in northern Africa and might have been the source of both the multiple  deluge myths from across different cultures, including that of Atlantis and Noah. The Sahara desert was once a lush area, and I've heard the the sands of the desert supposedly come from the ocean. I personally always thought that these areas were so dry due to lack of precipitation, but seeing how the rest of the earths landmass which inhabits the same areas just north of the equator can still sustain vegetation I think there might be another reason why we see this pattern stretched across three tectonic plates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me hear your thoughts. :D"

It's on all of them as a rectangular pond with a rectangular wall around it, but it's unlabeled.\n\nAccording to the following link, a large amount of destructive livestock was removed from the islands in the 1950s. It's possible it had something do to with that, or fishing, or quarrying. Needless to say, before (and for some time after) the area became a national seashore in the 1960s, there was a great deal of human activity.\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/science/9/chap4.htm\n\nA pretty staggering description from the same source, written in 1976:\n\n&gt;\"There are a great many camps on the island where the fishermen stay; clusters of them are sometimes surrounded by rings of abandoned cars towed there in an effort to protect the buildings from the sea (Fig. 115). Fishermen bring to the island an old car which they drive up and down the beach until it wears out or gets hopelessly stuck. This in itself does no real harm unless the car is driven over dune grass or through bird nesting grounds, but the car is eventually left to rust on the beach, where it is an esthetic insult and a safety hazard. No one wants to pay to have a valueless vehicle ferried ashore. There are probably over a thousand such hulks on Core Banks (Fig. 116). Most builders of cabins are squatting on the land, since at present most of the land in Cape Lookout National Seashore is owned by the state of North Carolina. Although some people have put up neat, decent little buildings, many of the cabins are unsightly, vermin-infested hovels surrounded by rubbish (Figs. 117 and 118). Such conditions will eventually be remedied by the National Park Service as it takes control of Cape Lookout National Seashore.\""

VMWare and Hyper-V desktops show a black background where you can still see the roads and names.  The white grid flashes at us.\n\nThe same thing happens in Chrome, IE, Edge and Firefox.\nThe same issue happens in Windows 10 and in Windows 7 with the exception that on our windows 7 virtual machines it DOES work within Chrome.  IE, edge and firefox are broken still.\n\nChecking f12 through the browsers is interesting.  It appears that we may be getting blocked with a recaptcha redirect on the satellite tile server?  If you move the map it tries to load in new tile data and is returning the following (as an example).  If you follow the sorry link you are faced with a recaptcha which I can solve and then eventually see the single satellite tile.  It does not fix the issue though.\n\nRedirect from 'https://khms2.google.com/kh/v=810?x=750&amp;y=1372&amp;z=12' to 'https://www.google.com/sorry/index?continue=https://khms2.google.com/kh/v%3D810%3Fx%3D750%26y%3D1372%26z%3D12&amp;q=EgRinlczGJ2ihN0FIhkA8aeDS2z_3Bk2U9WSu8OG3dpMXkvGH5lTMgFy' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https://www.google.ca' is therefore not allowed access.\n\n\nI noticed the working tiles are being received from kh.google.com where all of the broken redirected tiles on the virtual machines are being received from khms*.google.com\n\nThings I have tried to resolve this.\n\n* Checked video drivers and updated when possible.  We at first thought this was a VMWare issue until the same problem cropped up when a local Hyper-V pc was spun up.\n* Built a base windows 10 VM to ensure nothing in our build was causing issues.  Not logged into the domain or anything.  Just a windows 10 build logged in with local admin and satellite view is broken.\n* Tested all 4 browsers.  Only exception is our windows 7 machines it works in chrome.  Chrome updated to latest versions.\n* As mentioned above I have tested and this happens in vmware as well as hyper-v\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what to try?  This one has us stumped.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/g03qwTt"

If you look at a gradient from black to white, on which end of the spectrum is the background grey closest to?  The correct answer is WHITE.  It is very close to being WHITE.\n\nIf you zoom in on a piece of land with no other features (and you're being honest) your screen looks white.  If you were taking a casual test asking what color you see, you would say WHITE.\n\nBut that's not my point.  My point is CONTRAST.\n\nHave you ever drawn a map for somebody?  How did you do it?  You used ink or graphite on a light colored piece of paper or scrap of wood.  The contrast was near 100%.  Black + White.\n\nYou don't take a bottle of white out and paint a white line on a piece of grey paper.\n\nIf you want to argue over the definition of the color grey you can keep on doing that.

As a consequence, ZIP Code \"areas\" can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes ([rural route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_delivery_service) areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes, and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined.\n\nSo even if you had geographic shapes from the point clouds of buildings who have that zip code, they would have gaps in some places, and overlap in others."

This allows the company to analyze the total number of cars, and how fast they're going, on a road at any given time.\"\n\nif this is true, google maps is way superior than Waze but based on my understanding, all Android phones that has there GPS turned on are tracked by google to assess the traffic in an area. but is it not invasion of privacy?\n\nI dont care if it is, I just want to know. For me, using every GPS data on every android phone or iphones on the road is a very good way to know or predict the traffic unlike the Waze where it relies on traffic reports of other Waze users only.

        "body": "I LOVE the contributor section of GM. I like that on average, everyone in the city has seen one or two of my photos. Does anyone else love this? I'm wondering what your tips are for getting your photo to the top photo ribbon slots. I'll share my tips as well.  Look for what hasn't been photographed. In my experience, Google is looking for 3 things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  Storefront - from about the distance of the road\n2. overall atmosphere - Empty tables and chairs, empty tables and chairs, empty tables and chairs! Those shots have some of the highest percentage of success for me. Additionally you can shoot empty aisles for non food places\n3. product - close up glamor shots of your dinner plate or one product in particular from the shelves \n\nIf any one of these 3 are missing or lower quality than your photos, focus on that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, Google seems to love a few characteristics:\n\n1.  Natural light - about 70% of my top shots are lit entirely by the sun. So that dark restaurant that's so popular, take a photo by the window\n2. Good quality - goes without saying, but I'll say it. Lots of pixels make a better picture\n3. Recent - Given two photos of similar quality and value, I think Google is going to go with the more recent. So if you've lost the top spot somewhere, go photograph it again\n4. Avoid people - Particularly their faces pointing toward the camera. Of my top 20 photos, only a couple have people in them, but they're on the fringes of the photo and well separated from the subject. I think Google prefers an atmosphere shot of a place, but it's so hard to get without people, so it sticks storefronts and products in the top slot instead (so get those empty tables and chairs!)\n5. Video - There is a time and place for video, and you should take full advantage of it!  The top slot for a massive public place like the zoo, aquarium, or theme park is very, very difficult to get, but video can gain you serious viewership because of the way they're displayed on GM. When displayed, the video will play in the thumbnail and people can't help themselves but to click it to see more. I found the most successful place to be the zoo. People liked watching short (5-6s) clips of the animals (especially predators) moving in some way up close. \n6. Panoramic - I've had very little luck with panoramic. Only 1 of my top 20 was pano, and it was only on top for a month\n7. Photo sphere - Always good for at least a couple thousand views, but I've never seen it hit to top ribbon\n8. Portrait mode - Google seems to have no preference for portrait mode photos, but people still do view/click them more often than the regular photos 100 to 1 (maybe google should take the hint lol)\n9. Slow-mo -  Treat it just like portrait mode. People like to watch, but it will never make the top ribbon \n10. Other things I've tried that GM doesn't care about - Menus, product showcases or advertisements in the store, any decor or posters on the walls, anything with a human subject (even if they're not facing the camera), signage\n\nI'm about at the end of things I can be almost certain of, although I have more theories I'll be testing. What are your tips? "

It usually does not switch to the next turn until slowing down to a complete stop. For example, in this screenshot, I had already merged onto 110 North 3,850 feet ago. It should be displaying my next turn, but it only shows the last one in negative numbers.

For example, looking at Austin, TX: https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/austin, Civil Twilight for Oct 25, 2018 is listed as\n7:15 am - 7:40 am\n6:49 pm - 7:14 pm\n\nDoes the nightmode change you're seeing fall within those ranges? (Or, within any of the other \"twilight\" time windows given on that page? They could be, strangely, using something other than Civil Twilight.)\n\nIt also says \"Civil twilight occurs when the Sun is less than 6 degrees below the horizon. In the morning, civil twilight begins when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon and ends at sunrise. In the evening, it begins at sunset and ends when the Sun reaches 6 degrees below the horizon.\" which means it won't match the times you look up for \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\" (as sunrise will be the end of Civil Dawn but sunset will be the start of Civil Dusk). If Maps uses the end of Civil Dusk to switch to nightmode, it'd be happening 25 minutes after sunset, which would explain what you're seeing.\n\n\nIt looks like there are some programming libraries that do differentiate between the different twilights (https://github.com/ceeK/Solar#types-of-sunrise-and-sunset), so it wouldn't be surprising if Google Maps did so too.\n\n"

It is caused by two different GPS standards for the data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions\\_on\\_geographic\\_data\\_in\\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China)\n\n \n\n## The China GPS shift problem\n\nThe **China GPS shift (or offset) problem** is a class of issues stemming from the difference between the [GCJ-02](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#GCJ-02) and [WGS-84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS-84) [datums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum). [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) coordinates are expressed using the WGS-84 standard and when plotted on street maps of China that follow the GCJ-02 coordinates, they appear off by a large (often over 500 meters) and variable amount. Authorized providers of location-based services and digital maps (such as [AutoNavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoNavi) or [NavInfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NavInfo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)) must purchase a \"shift correction\" algorithm that enables plotting GPS locations correctly on the map.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-Corr-34) Satellite imagery and user-contributed street map data sets, such as those from [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) also display correctly because they have been collected using GPS devices (albeit technically illegally - see [Legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#Legislation)).\n\nSome map providers, such as [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_(company)), choose to also offset their satellite imagery layer to match the GCJ-02 street map.[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-35)\n\nGoogle has worked with Chinese [LBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service) provider [AutoNavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoNavi) since 2006 to source its maps in China.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-bloomberg-36) google.*cn*/maps (formerly Google Ditu) uses the GCJ-02 system for both its street maps[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-37) and satellite imagery.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-38) However, the WGS-84 positions reported by a browser are depicted at the wrong positions. On the contrary, google.*com*/maps also uses GCJ-02 data for the street map, but doesn't shift the satellite imagery layer, which continues to use WGS-84 coordinates,[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-39) with the benefit that WGS-84 positions can still be overlaid correctly on the satellite image (but not the street map). Google Earth also uses WGS-84 to display the satellite imagery.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-40)\n\nOverlaying GPS tracks on [Google.com Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps) and any street maps sourced from Google.com via its API, will lead to a similar display offset problem, because GPS tracks use WGS-84, and Google.com maps use GCJ-02. The issue has been reported numerous times on the Google Product Forums since 2009,[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-41) with 3rd party applications emerging to fix it.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-42) Data sets with offsets for large lists of Chinese cities existed for sale.[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-43) The problem was observed as early as 2008, and the causes were unclear, with (misguided) speculation that imported GPS chips were tampered with code that caused incorrect reporting of coordinates.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China&amp;section=6#cite_note-44)\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

There are many other features that are also not showing; you just do not realize because you cannot see them.  There is no way to influence this, other than making the feature as accurate as possible.\n\nBut it really shouldn't be a problem; people don't randomly scroll around the map looking for a plumber, a church, a dentist, a tire shop, etc; but rather they search. When someone searches for the type of establishment you have mapped then it will appear in the results, so everything is working fine.\n\nWhen someone enters no search terms at all or search terms unrelated to this feature, Google has determined that they are almost certainly not looking for this feature and thus it is safe not to show it.

The design of the road is based on safety. Some speeding is fine, I agree, because the road is designed to allow you to safely travel somewhat faster than the posted speed limit. But if you are SO concerned about speed traps that you need an app to protect you from getting caught, just get over yourself. Drive like there's always a speed trap. As you argue later on, going 5 or even 10 over the limit might not get you nabbed. Any faster than that and you're endangering lives.\n\nBut absolute speed absolutely affects safety. You can't make the same turn going 80 as you can at 60 and you can't stop as quickly going 60 as you can at 30. The outcomes are worse at higher speeds too. Damage becomes more significant, the likelihood of death increases, etc.\n\nExample 1: If you drive 29mph when everyone else is going 10mph you won't get a ticket for speeding. You may get a ticket for reckless driving or something else. But if it's a speed trap you're worried about, don't be.\n\nExample 2: Correct, for the reason I outline above, which is that speed limits are set based on the design of the road.\n\nExample 3: The 35'er is not \"very dangerous\", but they are frustrating, and when drivers become frustrated they become aggressive and dangerous. In all the hypothetical situations where someone is driving well-below the speed limit the only crashes that aren't caused by aggressive drivers are where there's a blind curve and as someone gains on the slower vehicle they don't it's there. Which is why if the speed limit is 50 and someone is going 35, they should be over to the right as far as practical and anyone who wants to pass has to wait until it is safe to pass. Anyone who has driven on a country road or up a hill behind a heavy truck knows how to handle this situation.\n\nIf they aren't as far over to the right as practical then that is illegal and they can be pulled over.\n\nSometimes speed traps are about ticketing people and collecting fines, but speed limits are not based on that, they are based on engineering, and sometimes just a desire to keep traffic slow in a neighbourhood (although, if the road design isn't adjusted as appropriate, then people are more likely to continue speeding).\n\nDon't speed. and if you do, don't speed by very much. Then you don't have to worry about speed traps."

That's not a good practice, but it happens. That doesn't mean the speed limit is meant to raise revenue through speeding ticket though, usually it's because the road does through a residential area or near a school or a hospital. They should change the design of the road in these areas, but you know how it is.  \n\n\nPolicing is often the largest budget item for a municipality. Minneapolis, for example, spends $163 BILLION per year on police ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/08/07/how-much-do-u-s-cities-spend-every-year-on-policing-infographic/#316a571ce7b7](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/08/07/how-much-do-u-s-cities-spend-every-year-on-policing-infographic/#316a571ce7b7)).

Please take the time to read the link I provided in my last comment.

The same scenario at 60mph is much much more likely to be lethal. You are much less likely to able to regain control of your vehicle. Even something like stopping distance is a factor of SPEED, not \"relative speed\".\n\nIf you nudge another car while travelling 80mph the chances of you both careening off the highway are much, much greater than a similar collision with the same \"relative speed\" but an absolute speed of 30mph.\n\nYou're not thinking critically about this."

But that is not the whole story which I have exhaustively explained above...  most accidents, other than fender-benders, are with other vehicles. Thus, a car that is going faster or SLOWER than the surrounding traffic is more dangerous than any arbitrary absolute speed. So, simply stating that a car, or cars, going above a speed limit is more dangerous is over simplified and misleading. The car going 35 when traffic is going 65 IS much more dangerous than the car going 70 is the same situation.\n\nHave you ever had the car in front of you move out of the way, only to find a much, much slower vehicle i front of him (now you)?  Or come around a bend and encountering a slowing or stopped vehicle?  Again, it's relative speed.\n\nYou may be an urban planner but I can tell you with certainty that speed limits have little or nothings to do with \"safety\" of the road. If that were the case, the autobahn would have the same or lower speed limits than american highways (which have more straight-aways and are wider).\n\nI've been dealing with this topic for 30 years... my dad was a engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers in Germany for 31 years and dealt with regular frequency with the Germans in a variety of projects, including building public roads.

All speed is relative.\n\nIn the event of suddenly encountering a slower vehicle, your speed relative to the road determines the distance it takes for you to come to a stop. Your speed relative to the other vehicle determines how much damage there is in the initial collision, but the speed of the two vehicles relative to the road determines what happens after that. The faster you are all going, the worse it is going to be.\n\nVehicle A is travelling 50mph, Vehicle B is travelling 45mph. Relative speed difference: 5mph. Severity of crash: moderate.\n\nVehicle C is travelling 80mph, Vehicle B is travelling 75mph. Relative speed difference: 5mph. Severity of crash: severe.\n\nAh, the mythically \"safe\" autobahn where there are no speed limits and nobody dies in crashes.\n\n1) Autobahn lanes are wider than American highway lanes. Look it up if you don't believe me.\n\n2) Only the straighter, more level sections of the autobahn have no speed limit.\n\n3) Do you want the same strict licensing system that Germany has?\n\n4) Here are some interesting stats: https://brandongaille.com/17-fascinating-autobahn-accident-statistics/\n\n&gt;67% of the accidents that occurred on the Autobahn happened in sections where there was no posted speed limit.\n&gt;A 2008 report from the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) looked at 645 road deaths in Germany, and found that 67 percent occurred on highway sections without limits.\n&gt;The accident rate on the Autobahn is consistently lower than many other interstate style highway systems, partly because of its better construction \u2013 it has a 40 year rating. The US highway system has a 20 year rating.\n&gt;The annual fatality rate on the Autobahn in 2.7 per billion kilometers traveled. The United States has a 4.5 fatality rate for the same distance and highly controlled speeds to boot.\n&gt;Most drivers stick to the advised speed limit (130km/h) on unregulated stretches of the Autobahn \u2013 only about 1/3 of drivers historically exceed the recommended speed limit.\n\nSo it really isn't the driving paradise you seem to think it is, and it isn't about \"relative speed\" between vehicles at all.\n\nOh, and this is interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn#Construction\n&gt;The top design speed was approximately 160 km/h (99 mph) in flat country but lower design speeds were used in hilly or mountainous terrain. A flat-country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the Nazi period, could support the speed of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) on curves.\n\nAnd here's the wiki page about \"design speed\" so we're all on the same page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_speed\n\nSo I hope you'll at least try to understand why I say that speed limits are \"based on\" the design of the road. It is not an arbitrary number meant to bring in as many speeding fines as possible.\n\nAnd I hope you will at least try to understand the reality of the fact that the faster you go, the less safe you and those around you are, because speed is relative to everything, not just the other vehicle you might hit."

Which seems like it would be a good idea except you have to drive past the parking area to the front door for maps to recognize you've arrived. Which leads me to having to exit nav on my own with out getting to the arrival screen. \n\nIt's almost as if they changed the way they calculate you have arrived at a business by making the area you have to enter smaller and closer to the entrance. It's just not realistic anymore; I do not need Nav through the parking lot lanes of the Mall to find it. \n\nIt's not a device issue, the GPS is accurate to within 10ft. \n\nHas anyone else noticed anything similar?"

Apart from this, its a conventional road maps, that offers aerial and satellite views of many places. In some cities. It also offers street views comprising photographs taken from vehicles.\n\nGoogle Maps features walking, driving and transit directions for both the iPad and iPhone along with voice guided GPS navigation. It is available on over 220 countries and territories with transit directions included for over 15,000 major cities around the world. It also comes with Google's popular Street View feature built right in to help you find exactly what you're looking for. It provides real-time estimated time of arrival using current traffic conditions and also provides alternate faster routes whenever possible, even during mid-travel.\n\n![img](9wnzib8so2y11 \"     Picture Courtesy-Infiflex \")\n\n \n\nHere are some of the benefits you can get from the new features which will become a game changer in the coming days-\n\n**Wealth of Information**\n\nGoogle Maps provides the layout of roads, the locations of towns and cities, state boundaries,  restaurant reviews, geographical features, and satellite images. It provides the Street View perspective, allowing you to see houses, storefronts and points of interest from a driver's point of view. In addition, It has indoor maps of some airports, museums and other facilities.\n\n**Sharing**\n\nUsing google maps, we can share maps with family, friends and colleagues, which makes gatherings easier to plan and coordinate. We can embed Google map information in web pages and emails and you can share maps through your Google or Facebook account.\n\n**Multiple Transportation Modes**\n\nThe Google Maps website gives you directions for trips by bike, car, foot or public transportation. The service has train and local bus schedules for many cities including bus and stop numbers and transfer points. For longer trips, it provides airline information including carriers and ticket price that serve your destination.\n\n**Demonstrates Quality**\n\nIt includes a  street view map direction is doing more than helping with the research process. It is demonstrating the quality of a business.\n\nBy providing this feature to a customer, you're showing that your business cares for its customers. And using google maps, it will do everything that can provide the best customer experience.\n\nSo, both of these aspects of the research process will increase the chances of customers visiting your business and making a purchase.\n\n**Huge Amounts Of Data**\n\nThen we have the monumental amount of data that Google has accumulated in order to provide users of Google Maps with the most complete framework with regards to other aspects of mapping. It provides things like traffic information, transit schedules, changes in city layouts, and so on. You simply have so much information to take advantage of that it barely makes sense to go with other map services.\n\nIf you are going to another country that you have never been to before, having the most up to date information on everything that goes on in the places you visit is particularly important. It is even including data on how crowded popular spots can be in real-time now."

Often the phone thinks I want to get off the highway at the stops, which I do not.

I did this on the phone while screen sharing with the tech and they had no clue what was going on. I read through your help forum. It is definitely an account setting somewhere but I cant find it. I went through every setting I could think of and find and compared it to my settings and they were all the same. Did everything to the app, clear cache, clear storage, uninstall updates, reinstall but nothing changes. It seems like an old legacy setting somewhere. Curious, are you or were you ever on Verizon or using a Motorola phone? That's what my wife came from and that's all I could think of. I might log into her Google account on the computer and on maps on a computer and see if there is a setting there that isn't on mobile that might prevent the options from showing up.

This causes delivery drivers to get stuck in a loop of death.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've moved all the business pins and the apartment building pin (all share a street address) to the actual street, but the base address pin (apparently what's used for navigation) remains on the back of the building.
